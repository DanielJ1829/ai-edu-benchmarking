Q1:
<span style="color:green">I can help you work through this integral! You're on the right track with integration by parts, but there's a small issue in your approach. Let me walk through the complete solution.</span> <Tn> [1]

For $\int_0^\pi e^x \sin(x)\, dx$, we need to use integration by parts twice because both $e^x$ and $\sin(x)$ have <span style="color:Yellow">simple derivatives and antiderivatives</span>. <Ed> [2]

<span style="color:green">Let's use integration by parts</span>: $\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du$ <Cl> [3]

**First application:**
- Let $u = \sin(x)$, so $du = \cos(x) \, dx$
- Let $dv = e^x \, dx$, so $v = e^x$

This gives us:
$$\int e^x \sin(x) \, dx = e^x \sin(x) - \int e^x \cos(x) \, dx$$

**Second application** (for the remaining integral):
- Let $u = \cos(x)$, so $du = -\sin(x) \, dx$
- Let $dv = e^x \, dx$, so $v = e^x$

This gives us:
$$\int e^x \cos(x) \, dx = e^x \cos(x) - \int e^x(-\sin(x)) \, dx = e^x \cos(x) + \int e^x \sin(x) \, dx$$

Now substituting back:
$$\int e^x \sin(x) \, dx = e^x \sin(x) - [e^x \cos(x) + \int e^x \sin(x) \, dx]$$

$$\int e^x \sin(x) \, dx = e^x \sin(x) - e^x \cos(x) - \int e^x \sin(x) \, dx$$

Adding $\int e^x \sin(x) \, dx$ to both sides:
$$2\int e^x \sin(x) \, dx = e^x \sin(x) - e^x \cos(x) = e^x(\sin(x) - \cos(x))$$

Therefore:
$$\int e^x \sin(x) \, dx = \frac{e^x(\sin(x) - \cos(x))}{2}$$

**Now evaluating the definite integral:**
$$\int_0^\pi e^x \sin(x) \, dx = \left[\frac{e^x(\sin(x) - \cos(x))}{2}\right]_0^\pi$$

At $x = \pi$: $\sin(\pi) = 0$, $\cos(\pi) = -1$
At $x = 0$: $\sin(0) = 0$, $\cos(0) = 1$

$$= \frac{e^\pi(0 - (-1))}{2} - \frac{e^0(0 - 1)}{2} = \frac{e^\pi}{2} - \frac{-1}{2} = \frac{e^\pi + 1}{2}$$

So the correct answer is $\frac{e^\pi + 1}{2}$, not $1 + e^\pi$.

<span style="color:yellow">The key insight you were missing is that integration by parts needs to be applied twice for this type of integral, and you need to solve for the original integral algebraically when it reappears.</span> <Ed> [4]

------------
[1] - An example of good tone, appropriate and encouraging for the student

[2] - A possibly ambiguous/incoherent explanation for why only two applications of the formula works. For example, $x e^x$ has simple derivatives/antiderivatives by the usual meaning of 'simple', but only one IBP is required. (mark down for only clarity)

[3] - By stating the definition of the formula, then clearly signposting how to complete this integral with brackets kept in, showing little ambiguity is excellent for the student's level.

[4] - 'this type of integral' is potentially ambiguous, though this sentence equips the student with the correct reasoning on how to solve integrals where applying IBP once requires another IBP for a solution.

Q2:
<span style="color:Yellow">I can see where you're getting confused! Let me walk through your reasoning and identify the issue.</span> <Tn> [1]

<span style="color:green">Your approach of using the kinematic equation s = ut + ½at² is correct, and you're right to think about when the projectile returns to ground level (s = 0 vertically)</span>. <Tn> [2] However, there's a key distinction you're missing.

Let me break down what you did:
- You used the vertical motion equation: 0 = u_y·t - ½gt²
- <span style="color:red">Solving for t: t = 2u_y/g = 2v₀sin(30°)/g = 2(20)(0.5)/9.8 ≈ 2.04 s</span> <Ed> [3]
- <span style="color:yellow">Then you calculated distance as u·t, which gives you about 81.5m </span> <Cm> [4]

**The problem:** <span style="color:red">You're calculating the horizontal distance traveled, not the total distance</span> <Cl, Ed> [5]. When you use "u·t", you're using the initial speed v₀ = 20 m/s, but the projectile doesn't travel in the direction of its initial velocity for the entire flight.

**What you should calculate:** The horizontal distance (range) is:
- Horizontal velocity: v_x = v₀cos(30°) = 20 × (√3/2) ≈ 17.32 m/s
- Horizontal distance: R = v_x × t = 17.32 × 2.04 ≈ 35.3 m

Since the slope has angle α = 0° (horizontal ground), the distance along the slope is simply the horizontal distance: **35.3 m**.

<span style="color:red">The 81.5m you calculated would be the distance if the projectile somehow maintained its initial velocity direction throughout the flight, which isn't what happens in projectile motion.</span> <Cl> [6]

 <span style="color:green">The key insight: in projectile motion, only the horizontal velocity component remains constant (ignoring air resistance), while the vertical component changes due to gravity.</span> <Ed> [7]

------------
[1] – The tone here is somewhat supportive but leans neutral in that it does not fully engage the student’s perspective.

[2] – Strong example of an encouraging tone. It validates the student’s chosen approach and builds confidence.

[3] – While the numerical value for t is correct, the response incorrectly assumes the student also derived this, an inaccurate reconstruction of the student’s reasoning.

[4] – This step attributes a calculation to the student that they likely did not perform, leading to an inconsistent and mathematically invalid intermediate result.

[5] – The explanation of the student’s error is ambiguous. The statement that the student computed “horizontal distance instead of total distance” is misleading: in this problem, the distance along the slope is the horizontal displacement; the total distance would require a path integral.

[6] – Hypothetical reasoning (“if the velocity stayed the same…”) introduces conceptual confusion. The suggestion implies indefinite motion rather than clarifying why the student’s result is invalid.

[7] – A strong educational point: highlights the key principle that horizontal velocity remains constant while vertical velocity changes under gravity. This equips the student with a transferable insight.

Q3:
<span style="color:Yellow">Let me check your work step by step.</span> <Tn> [1]

<span style="color:Green">First, let's identify the coefficients in the quadratic equation when k=0 and p=1</span>: <Cl> [2]
$3x^2 + (p+3k)x - (p^2-3k) = 0$

When k=0 and p=1:
- $a = 3$
- $b = p + 3k = 1 + 3(0) = 1$
- $c = -(p^2 - 3k) = -(1^2 - 3(0)) = -1$

So the equation becomes: $3x^2 + x - 1 = 0$

Now using the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4(3)(-1)}}{2(3)}$

$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 12}}{6}$

$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{6}$

I notice you wrote "x = (-1+sqrt(1-(4)(3)(-1)))/6" but you seem to have made a small error in the discriminant calculation. You wrote "sqrt(1-(4)(3)(-1))" <span style="color:Yellow">but it should be "sqrt(1**+**(4)(3)(1))" since $-4ac = -4(3)(-1) = +12$</span> <Cl> <Cm> <Ed> [3]

So the correct discriminant is $1 + 12 = 13$, which you did get right in your final answer.

<span style="color:green">Your final result $x = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{6}$ is correct for one of the roots (you found the positive root). The complete solution would be:</span> <Ed> <Cm> [4]

$x = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{6}$ or $x = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{13}}{6}$

<span style="color:yellow">So your calculation is essentially correct - you just had a minor notation issue in the middle step, but your final answer is right!</span> <Ed> <Cl> [5]

------------

[1] - Neutral tone

[2] - A good example of clarity in deriving the solution

Q4:
I can see where you've gotten confused! There are a couple of issues with your approach that I'll help you work through.

<span style="color:Green">**First issue: Ohm's Law**
You wrote Ohm's law as I = VR, but the correct formula is:
**I = V/R** (current equals voltage divided by resistance)</span>  <Cl> <Ed> [1]

**Second issue: Current calculation**
<span style="color:red">When you calculated I₁ = 120A, I₂ = 240A, and I₃ = 180A, you used I = VR instead of I = V/R. Let's recalculate:</span> <Cl> <Ed> [2]

For parallel circuits, each resistor sees the same voltage (12V), so:
- I₁ = V/R₁ = 12V/10Ω = **1.2A**
- I₂ = V/R₂ = 12V/20Ω = **0.6A**  
- I₃ = V/R₃ = 12V/15Ω = **0.8A**

**Total current:**
In parallel circuits, currents add up:
I_total = I₁ + I₂ + I₃ = 1.2 + 0.6 + 0.8 = **2.6A**

**Equivalent resistance:**
You were on the right track with the parallel resistance formula. For resistors in parallel:
1/R_eq = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃
1/R_eq = 1/10 + 1/20 + 1/15
1/R_eq = 6/60 + 3/60 + 4/60 = 13/60
R_eq = 60/13 ≈ **4.62Ω**

<span style="color:green">**Check:** Using I = V/R_eq = 12V/(60/13)Ω = 12 × 13/60 = 2.6A ✓</span> [3]

<span style="color:green">So your equivalent resistance calculation was correct, but the total current should be 2.6A, not 55.4A. The key was fixing the Ohm's law formula!</span> <Ed> <Tn> [4]

Q5:
Looking at your solution, I need to point out that there's an issue with your approach. Let me work through this step-by-step to show you the correct method.

First, let's establish what we know:
- Square area = 8 m², so each side length = √8 = 2√2 m
- The sector has a 90° central angle
- Two vertices lie on the radii, two on the arc

The key insight is understanding the geometry. If we place the sector with its vertex at the origin and the two radii along the positive x and y axes, then due to symmetry, <span style="color:red">the square will be positioned at a 45° angle to these axes.</span>  <Cl> <Cr> [1]

<span style="color:yellow">Let me set up coordinates. If the square has side length s = 2√2, and it's rotated 45° from the axes, then the distance from the center of the circle to any vertex on the arc can be found using the constraint that these vertices must lie on both the square and the circular arc.</span> <Cm> <Cl> <Cr> [2]

<span style="color:yellow">For a square inscribed this way in a 90° sector, if we call the distance from the origin to a corner vertex d, then the geometry gives us:

The square's diagonal from center to corner vertex, when the square is at 45° to the radii, creates a specific relationship. The distance d must satisfy the constraint that the vertex lies on the circle of radius r.</span> <Cl> <Cm> [3]

<span style="color:red">Through the geometric relationship in this configuration:
d = s√2 = 2√2 × √2 = 4 meters</span> <Cr> <Cl> [4]

<span style="color:red">So your final answer of x = 4√2 ≈ 5.66 meters is incorrect. The correct distance is **4 meters**.</span> <Cr> [5]

<span style="color:yellow">Your error was in the trigonometric relationship. The expression "x = A cos(45°)" doesn't correctly capture the geometric relationship in this problem. The actual relationship involves the square's orientation and how it fits within the sector, not a simple trigonometric function of the area.</span> <Cm> <Ed> [6]


The correct approach involves recognizing that for a square inscribed in a 90° sector with this specific orientation, the distance from center to corner vertex equals the square's side length times √2, which gives us exactly 4 meters.

------------

[1] - Correct however, should say 'the square's uppermost vertex' otherwise ambiguous

[2] - Incorrect logic (premise/conclusion unrelated), unclear, disrupting learning

[3] - Correct constraint, however restatement of square's orientation is over explained and unclear.

Q6:
Let me check your working step by step.

First, let's clarify the setup: we have 5 blue balls, 3 red balls, 0 black balls (so 8 total), and we're drawing 3 balls without replacement. We want exactly 2 red balls.

Your approach has the right idea, but there's an important issue with the order and calculation:

**Your calculation:** 3/8 × 2/7 × 5/6

<span style="color:green">This calculates the probability of drawing red, then red, then blue in that specific order. However, there are multiple ways to get exactly 2 red balls out of 3 draws:
- Red, Red, Blue (RRB)
- Red, Blue, Red (RBR)  
- Blue, Red, Red (BRR)</span>  <Cl> <Cm> <Ed> [1]

**The correct approach:**

<span style="color:green">Method 1 - Count all orderings:
- P(RRB) = (3/8) × (2/7) × (5/6) = 30/336
- P(RBR) = (3/8) × (5/7) × (2/6) = 30/336
- P(BRR) = (5/8) × (3/7) × (2/6) = 30/336

Total probability = 30/336 + 30/336 + 30/336 = 90/336 = 15/56</span> <Cl> [2]

<span style="color:yellow">Method 2 - Use combinations (hypergeometric distribution):
P = C(3,2) × C(5,1) / C(8,3) = 3 × 5 / 56 = 15/56</span> [3]

So your calculation gave you 30/336 = 5/84, but the correct answer is 15/56 = 45/252 = 15/84.

<span style="color:()">You were missing the factor of 3 because there are 3 different orders to arrange 2 red balls and 1 blue ball in 3 positions.</span>  [4]
