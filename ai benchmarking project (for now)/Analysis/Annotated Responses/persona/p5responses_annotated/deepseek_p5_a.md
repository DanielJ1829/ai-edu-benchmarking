Q1:
<span style="color:green">Hello! It's great to hear that you're keeping your brain active with math problems. Don't worry about getting things wrong at first—that's a natural part of the learning process, especially when revisiting topics after a long time. I'm happy to help you with this integration problem.</span> <Tn> [1]

Let's start by evaluating the indefinite integral:
$$
I = \int e^x \sin(x)  dx.
$$

<span style="color:yellow">This integral is a classic example that requires integration by parts. Recall the integration by parts formula:</span> <Ed> <Cl> [2]
$$
\int u  dv = uv - \int v  du.
$$

We'll apply this twice. Let:
$$
u = \sin(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad du = \cos(x)  dx,
$$
$$
dv = e^x  dx \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = e^x.
$$

Then:
$$
I = \int e^x \sin(x)  dx = e^x \sin(x) - \int e^x \cos(x)  dx.
$$

Now, we need to evaluate \(\int e^x \cos(x)  dx\). Apply integration by parts again. Let:
$$
u = \cos(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad du = -\sin(x)  dx,
$$
$$
dv = e^x  dx \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = e^x.
$$

So:
$$
\int e^x \cos(x)  dx = e^x \cos(x) - \int e^x (-\sin(x))  dx = e^x \cos(x) + \int e^x \sin(x)  dx.
$$

Notice that \(\int e^x \sin(x)  dx = I\). Substitute back:
$$
I = e^x \sin(x) - \left[ e^x \cos(x) + I \right] = e^x \sin(x) - e^x \cos(x) - I.
$$

Now, bring all terms involving \(I\) to one side:
$$
I + I = e^x \sin(x) - e^x \cos(x),
$$
$$
2I = e^x (\sin(x) - \cos(x)),
$$
$$
I = \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin(x) - \cos(x)) + C,
$$
where \(C\) is the constant of integration.

So, the indefinite integral is:
$$
\int e^x \sin(x)  dx = \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin(x) - \cos(x)) + C.
$$

Now, let's move to the definite integral:
$$
\int_0^\pi e^x \sin(x)  dx.
$$

We can use the antiderivative we just found. So:
$$
\int_0^\pi e^x \sin(x)  dx = \left[ \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin(x) - \cos(x)) \right]_0^\pi.
$$

Evaluate at the upper limit \(x = \pi\):
$$
\frac{e^\pi}{2} (\sin(\pi) - \cos(\pi)) = \frac{e^\pi}{2} (0 - (-1)) = \frac{e^\pi}{2} (1) = \frac{e^\pi}{2}.
$$

Evaluate at the lower limit \(x = 0\):
$$
\frac{e^0}{2} (\sin(0) - \cos(0)) = \frac{1}{2} (0 - 1) = \frac{1}{2} (-1) = -\frac{1}{2}.
$$

Therefore:
$$
\int_0^\pi e^x \sin(x)  dx = \frac{e^\pi}{2} - \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{e^\pi}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{e^\pi + 1}{2}.
$$

So, the value of the definite integral is \(\frac{e^\pi + 1}{2}\).

<span style="color:green">Now, to address your initial thought: you mentioned that since \(\sin(\pi) = 0\) and \(\sin(0) = 0\), and wondered if this might be related to an odd function making the integral zero. However, \(e^x \sin(x)\) is not an odd function. An odd function satisfies \(f(-x) = -f(x)\). Here, \(e^x\) is not odd (it's not even defined for negative \(x\) in the same way), and while \(\sin(x)\) is odd, the product \(e^x \sin(x)\) is not odd because \(e^x\) is not even or odd. Therefore, the integral over symmetric limits (like \([-a, a]\)) would not necessarily be zero. In this case, the limits are \([0, \pi]\), which are not symmetric about zero, so we cannot use that property.

Thus, the integral is not zero, and we have computed it to be \(\frac{e^\pi + 1}{2}\).</span> <Cm> <Cl> <Ed> [3]

Q2:
<span style="color:green">Hello! It's great to see an adult learner diving back into math and physics – and don't worry about getting things wrong at first; that's a completely normal part of the process. Your memory is correct: the SUVAT equations (also known as the equations of motion) are indeed the perfect tool for this problem.</span> <Tn> [1]

Let's break this down step-by-step.

### 1. Understanding the Scenario

*   The projectile is launched **down a slope** inclined at **-α**. Since α = 0°, the slope is actually flat (a horizontal plane). The negative sign is a convention to show it's descending, but a 0° incline is just flat ground.
*   Initial speed, $v_0 = 20$ m/s.
*   Launch angle, $\theta = 30^\circ$ above the horizontal.
*   We need to find the **range** (the horizontal distance traveled before it hits the ground).

This simplifies the problem significantly. We are now just finding the range of a projectile launched on level ground.

### 2. Recall the SUVAT Equations and Setup

The SUVAT equations describe motion with constant acceleration. For projectile motion (with no air resistance), the acceleration is:
*   $a_x = 0$ (horizontal direction)
*   $a_y = -g$ (vertical direction, where $g \approx 9.8$ m/s²)

We have initial velocity components:
*   $u_x = v_0 \cos\theta = 20 \cos(30^\circ) = 20 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 10\sqrt{3}$ m/s
*   $u_y = v_0 \sin\theta = 20 \sin(30^\circ) = 20 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10$ m/s

### 3. Find the Time of Flight (T)

The projectile lands when its vertical displacement ($s_y$) is zero. We'll use the SUVAT equation for vertical motion:
$s_y = u_y t + \frac{1}{2} a_y t^2$

Setting $s_y = 0$ (it starts and ends at ground level):
$0 = (u_y) t + \frac{1}{2} (-g) t^2$
$0 = 10t - \frac{1}{2}(9.8)t^2$ (Let's use $g = 9.8$ m/s²)
$0 = t(10 - 4.9t)$

This gives two solutions:
$t = 0$ s (the launch moment)
$10 - 4.9t = 0 \implies t = \frac{10}{4.9} \approx 2.0408$ s

So, the **time of flight** is $T \approx 2.04$ seconds.

### 4. Find the Horizontal Distance (Range, R)

Now we use the horizontal motion. Since there is no horizontal acceleration ($a_x = 0$), the equation is simple:
$s_x = u_x t$

We use the full time of flight, $T$:
$R = u_x \times T = (10\sqrt{3}) \times (10 / 4.9)$

Let's calculate this step-by-step:
1.  $10\sqrt{3} \approx 10 \times 1.732 = 17.32$ m/s
2.  $R = 17.32 \times 2.0408 \approx 35.35$ meters

We can also write this as a single formula, which is the standard formula for the range on a horizontal surface:
$R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$

Let's verify with this formula:
1.  $v_0^2 = 20^2 = 400$
2.  $\sin(2\theta) = \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660$
3.  $\textcolor{yellow}{R = \frac{400 \times 0.8660}{9.8} = \frac{346.41}{9.8} \approx 35.35}$<span style="color:yellow"> meters </span> <Cl> [2]

Both methods give the same result!

### 5. Final Answer

Since the slope angle $\alpha$ is $0^\circ$, the distance traveled along the slope is simply the horizontal range.

**The distance traveled along the slope is approximately 35.3 meters.**

I hope this detailed walk-through was helpful! It's fantastic that you're keeping your brain engaged with these problems. The SUVAT equations are your best friends for constant acceleration scenarios like this one. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions

Q3:
<span style="color:green">Hello! I'd be happy to help you with this quadratic equation. It's completely normal to feel a bit rusty after 15 years, but we'll get through this step by step.</span> <Tn> [1]

<span style="color:green">Let's start by recalling the quadratic formula. For an equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the roots are given by:</span>
$$
\textcolor{green}{x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}}
$$
<Cl> <Ed> [2]

In your equation:
$$
3x^2 + (p+3k)x - (p^2 - 3k) = 0
$$
So, we identify:
- \( a = 3 \)
- \( b = p + 3k \)
- \( c = -(p^2 - 3k) = -p^2 + 3k \)

Now, the discriminant \( D \) is:
$$
D = b^2 - 4ac = (p + 3k)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-p^2 + 3k)
$$
Let's expand this:
First, \( (p + 3k)^2 = p^2 + 6pk + 9k^2 \)
Then, \( -4ac = -4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-p^2 + 3k) = -12(-p^2 + 3k) = 12p^2 - 36k \)
So,
$$
D = p^2 + 6pk + 9k^2 + 12p^2 - 36k = 13p^2 + 6pk + 9k^2 - 36k
$$

Therefore, the roots are:
$$
x = \frac{-(p + 3k) \pm \sqrt{13p^2 + 6pk + 9k^2 - 36k}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-(p + 3k) \pm \sqrt{13p^2 + 6pk + 9k^2 - 36k}}{6}
$$

Now, let's study the case when \( k = 0 \) and \( p = 1 \).

Plug in \( k = 0 \), \( p = 1 \):
Then the equation becomes:
$$
3x^2 + (1 + 3 \cdot 0)x - (1^2 - 3 \cdot 0) = 0 \implies 3x^2 + 1 \cdot x - (1 - 0) = 0 \implies 3x^2 + x - 1 = 0
$$

So, we have:
$$
3x^2 + x - 1 = 0
$$
Now, let's solve this using the quadratic formula:
Here, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = -1 \).

Discriminant:
$$
D = b^2 - 4ac = 1^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-1) = 1 + 12 = 13
$$

So,
$$
x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{6}
$$

Therefore, the roots are:
$$
x_1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{6}, \quad x_2 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{13}}{6}
$$

<span style="color:green">Now, let's verify these roots by plugging them back into the equation \( 3x^2 + x - 1 = 0 \).</span> <Ed> <Cl> [3]

First, approximate \( \sqrt{13} \approx 3.6056 \), so:
$$
x_1 \approx \frac{-1 + 3.6056}{6} = \frac{2.6056}{6} \approx 0.4343
$$
$$
x_2 \approx \frac{-1 - 3.6056}{6} = \frac{-4.6056}{6} \approx -0.7676
$$

Now, check \( x_1 \approx 0.4343 \):
$$
3(0.4343)^2 + 0.4343 - 1 \approx 3(0.1886) + 0.4343 - 1 \approx 0.5658 + 0.4343 - 1 = 1.0001 - 1 \approx 0.0001 \approx 0
$$
Similarly, for \( x_2 \approx -0.7676 \):
$$
3(-0.7676)^2 + (-0.7676) - 1 \approx 3(0.5892) - 0.7676 - 1 \approx 1.7676 - 0.7676 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0
$$
So, both roots satisfy the equation (the small error is due to rounding).

<span style="color:red">You mentioned that you were getting 2 or -7/3. It seems you might have made an error in identifying the coefficients. For instance, when \( k=0, p=1 \), the equation is \( 3x^2 + x - 1 = 0 \), not something that gives roots 2 or -7/3.</span> <Cr> <Ed> [4]

If you plug in x=2:
$$
3(2)^2 + 2 - 1 = 12 + 2 - 1 = 13 \neq 0
$$
x = -7/3:
$$
3(-7/3)^2 + (-7/3) - 1 = 3(49/9) - 7/3 - 1 = 49/3 - 7/3 - 1 = 42/3 - 1 = 14 - 1 = 13 \neq 0
$$
So indeed, these are not roots.

I hope this clears up the confusion! The correct roots for \( k=0, p=1 \) are \( \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{6} \).

To summarize:
- The general solution for the quadratic is \( x = \frac{-(p+3k) \pm \sqrt{13p^2 + 6pk + 9k^2 - 36k}}{6} \).
- For \( k=0, p=1 \), the roots are \( \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{6} \).

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask! Keep practicing, and it will all come back to you. 😊

Q4:
<span style="color:green">Hello! It's great that you're getting back into math and physics – and don't worry at all about things being foggy. This is a very common feeling after a long break, and it's exactly why practice problems are so useful! You're on the right track with your thinking, but there's one crucial concept about parallel circuits that will clear everything up.</span> <Tn> [1]

Let's walk through this step-by-step.

### The Key Concept: Voltage in Parallel Circuits

In a parallel circuit, the key thing to remember is that **the voltage across each resistor is the same**. They are all connected directly to the power supply. So, the voltage across R₁, R₂, and R₃ is all 12 V.

This is different from a series circuit, where the current is the same through all components.

### The Correct Approach Using Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law is your best friend here: **V = I × R**, which we can rearrange to **I = V / R**.

Since each resistor has the same voltage (12 V) across it, we can find the current through each one *individually*.

**Step 1: Find the current through R₁ (10 Ω)**
I₁ = V / R₁ = 12 V / 10 Ω = **1.2 A**

**Step 2: Find the current through R₂ (20 Ω)**
I₂ = V / R₂ = 12 V / 20 Ω = **0.6 A**

**Step 3: Find the current through R₃ (15 Ω)**
I₃ = V / R₃ = 12 V / 15 Ω = **0.8 A**

And that's it! You've found the current through each resistor.

### Why Your Initial Approach Didn't Work

You correctly identified that you could find the *total* current first. Let's do that to check our work and see where the confusion was.

**Finding Total Resistance (R_total) in Parallel:**
Resistors in parallel *do not* simply add up. The formula for the total resistance in parallel is:

1/R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃

Let's calculate that:
1/R_total = 1/10 + 1/20 + 1/15

To add these, find a common denominator (60 is a good one):
1/R_total = (6/60) + (3/60) + (4/60) = 13/60

Therefore, R_total = 60/13 Ω ≈ 4.615 Ω

**Finding Total Current (I_total) from the Supply:**
Using Ohm's Law on the whole circuit:
I_total = V / R_total = 12 V / (60/13 Ω)

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:
I_total = 12 × (13/60) = 156/60 = **2.6 A**

<span style="color:green">**Checking Our Individual Currents:**
In a parallel circuit, the total current is the *sum* of the currents through each branch.
I_total = I₁ + I₂ + I₃
Let's check: 1.2 A + 0.6 A + 0.8 A = **2.6 A** ✔️

It matches perfectly!</span> <Cl> <Ed> [2] Your initial method of splitting the total current by the *fraction of resistance* is how you would solve a *series* circuit. For a parallel circuit, you split the current by the *ease of flow* (conductance, which is 1/R). The smallest resistor gets the most current.

<span style="color:green">### Summary and Final Answer

Because the resistors are in parallel, the voltage across each is the full 12 V from the supply. Using Ohm's Law (I = V / R) for each resistor individually is the most straightforward method.

*   **Current through R₁ (10 Ω):** I₁ = 12 V / 10 Ω = **1.2 A**
*   **Current through R₂ (20 Ω):** I₂ = 12 V / 20 Ω = **0.6 A**
*   **Current through R₃ (15 Ω):** I₃ = 12 V / 15 Ω = **0.8 A**

Q5:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Given:**
- A square is inscribed in a circular sector of radius \( r \) and central angle \( \theta = 90^\circ \).
- Two vertices of the square lie on the two radii (bounding the sector), and the other two lie on the arc.
- The area of the square is \( 8  \text{m}^2 \), so each side of the square has length \( s = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}  \text{m} \).
- We need to find the distance from the top-right vertex of the square (the one on the arc) to the center of the circle.

Let's set up a coordinate system to model the situation:
- Place the center of the circle at the origin \( O = (0, 0) \).
- The sector is bounded by the positive x-axis and positive y-axis (since \( \theta = 90^\circ \)).
- The square is inscribed such that:
  - One vertex is on the positive x-axis (say \( A \)).
  - One vertex is on the positive y-axis (say \( B \)).
  - The other two vertices are on the arc (say \( C \) and \( D \)), with \( C \) being the top-right vertex (farthest from the origin).

Let:
- \( A = (a, 0) \) on the x-axis.
- \( B = (0, b) \) on the y-axis.
Since it's a square, the side length is \( s = 2\sqrt{2} \).

The square is oriented such that the sides are not necessarily horizontal/vertical. However, because the sector is symmetric with respect to the line \( y = x \), we can assume that the square is symmetric with respect to this line. This implies that \( a = b \).

So, let \( A = (d, 0) \) and \( B = (0, d) \), where \( d \) is the distance from the origin to the vertices on the axes.

<span style="color:yellow">Now, the vector from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( (-d, d) \), which has length \( \sqrt{2} d \). But this is not the side of the square; it is the diagonal of the square? Wait, no: actually, \( A \) and \( B \) are adjacent vertices of the square? Actually, the square has vertices on the two radii and two on the arc. So the vertices in order might be:
- \( A \) on the x-axis,
- \( D \) on the arc (bottom-right?),
- \( C \) on the arc (top-right),
- \( B \) on the y-axis.

But from symmetry, it is easier to consider:
Let the square have vertices:
- \( A = (d, 0) \) on the x-axis,
- \( B = (0, d) \) on the y-axis,
- \( C \) on the arc (top-right),
- \( D \) on the arc (but actually, the fourth vertex is not on the arc? Wait, only two are on the arc.</span> <Cm> <Cl> [1]

Actually, the problem says: "Two vertices lie on the radii, two lie on the arc." So the vertices on the radii are \( A \) and \( B \), and the ones on the arc are \( C \) and \( D \), with \( C \) being the top-right.

Now, since it is a square, the side length is \( s \).
The vector from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( (-d, d) \), but this is not a side of the square; it is actually the diagonal of the square? Wait, no: if \( A \) and \( B \) are adjacent vertices, then the distance between them should be \( s \). But \( |AB| = \sqrt{d^2 + d^2} = d\sqrt{2} \). So \( s = d\sqrt{2} \).

But we know \( s = 2\sqrt{2} \), so \( d\sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} \implies d = 2 \).

So \( A = (2, 0) \), \( B = (0, 2) \).

Now, the square has side length \( s = 2\sqrt{2} \). The next vertex from \( A \) (say \( D \)) should be obtained by rotating the vector from \( A \) to \( B \) by \( 90^\circ \) (since it's a square). But actually, the order of vertices is important.

Let's define the square:
Let the vertices be in order: \( A \) (on x-axis), \( D \) (on arc), \( C \) (on arc, top-right), \( B \) (on y-axis).

So, from \( A \) to \( B \) is not a side; it is a diagonal? Actually, if \( A \) and \( B \) are on the radii, they are not adjacent? They are adjacent if the square is oriented with its sides at \( 45^\circ \) to the axes.

In fact, from symmetry, the square is oriented at \( 45^\circ \) to the axes. Then the vertices on the axes are actually the midpoints of the sides? But no, they are vertices.

Wait, let's reconsider:

We have \( A = (d, 0) \) and \( B = (0, d) \). For these to be vertices of the square, the square must have its sides at \( 45^\circ \) to the axes. Then the side length \( s \) is related to \( d \) by: the distance from the center to a vertex on the axis is \( d = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \) (because the diagonal of the square is \( s\sqrt{2} \), and the distance from the center of the square to a vertex is half the diagonal = \( s/\sqrt{2} \), but here the center is not the origin).

Actually, in this configuration, the origin is not the center of the square.

Let's derive properly.

Let the square have vertices:
- \( A = (d, 0) \) on x-axis.
- \( B = (0, d) \) on y-axis.
- \( C = (x_c, y_c) \) on the arc (top-right).
- \( D = (x_d, y_d) \) on the arc.

Since it is a square, the vectors between adjacent vertices are perpendicular and of equal length.

Consider vectors:
\( \vec{AB} = (-d, d) \)
\( \vec{AD} = (x_d - d, y_d - 0) \)

For \( A \) to \( B \) to be a side, we must have \( |AB| = s \), so \( \sqrt{2} d = s = 2\sqrt{2} \implies d = 2 \).

Then \( \vec{AB} = (-2, 2) \).

The next side from \( A \) should be perpendicular to \( AB \). A perpendicular vector to \( (-2,2) \) is \( (2,2) \) (since dot product: -2*2 + 2*2 = 0). So \( \vec{AD} = k(2,2) \). But the length should be \( s = 2\sqrt{2} \), so \( k \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \implies k \cdot 2\sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} \implies k=1 \).

So \( \vec{AD} = (2,2) \), so \( D = A + (2,2) = (2+2, 0+2) = (4,2) \).

Then the next vertex \( C = D + \vec{DC} = D + \vec{AB} \) (since opposite sides are parallel), so \( C = (4,2) + (-2,2) = (2,4) \).

And indeed, \( B = (0,2) \), and \( \vec{BC} = (2-0, 4-2) = (2,2) = \vec{AD} \), consistent.

So the square has vertices:
\( A = (2,0) \)
\( D = (4,2) \)
\( C = (2,4) \)
\( B = (0,2) \)

Now, check which are on the arc: \( C \) and \( D \) should lie on the circle of radius \( r \) centered at the origin.

So for \( C = (2,4) \): distance from origin = \( \sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{4+16} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \).
For \( D = (4,2) \): same distance \( 2\sqrt{5} \).

So the radius \( r = 2\sqrt{5} \).

The top-right vertex is \( C = (2,4) \).
The distance from \( C \) to the origin (center) is \( 2\sqrt{5} \).

But the problem asks: "Find the distance between the top-right square vertex and the circle center." This is exactly \( r = 2\sqrt{5} \).

So the answer is \( 2\sqrt{5} \) meters.

**Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}
$$

This is the distance from the top-right vertex (on the arc) to the center of the circle.

Q6:
<span style="color:green">Hello! It's great that you're getting back into math—it's like riding a bike, but sometimes the bike has changed a bit! Don't worry about getting things wrong at first; that's part of the learning process. Let's break down this problem step by step.</span> <Tn> [1]

<span style="color:green">You're absolutely right that the order matters and that we need to consider different sequences (like in a tree diagram). However, since we're drawing without replacement, the probabilities change after each draw. Also, because we're only concerned with the number of red balls (and not the order in which they appear), we can use combinations to make things easier.</span> <Cl> <Ed> [2]

Given:
- Blue balls: \( n = 5 \)
- Red balls: \( m = 3 \)
- Black balls: \( k = 0 \) (so no black balls)
- Total balls: \( 5 + 3 + 0 = 8 \)
- We draw \( r = 3 \) balls without replacement.
- We want exactly \( q = 2 \) red balls.

So, we want the probability that exactly 2 out of the 3 drawn balls are red.

**Step 1: Understand the total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 8.**
<span style="color:green">**Step 1: Understand the total number of ways to draw 3 balls from 8.**
Since order doesn't matter (we only care about which balls are drawn, not the sequence), we use combinations.
Total number of ways to choose 3 balls from 8: \( \binom{8}{3} \).</span> <Cm> <Cl> <Ed> [3]

**Step 2: Understand the number of favorable outcomes.**
We want exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball (since there are no black balls).
- Number of ways to choose 2 red balls from 3: \( \binom{3}{2} \).
- Number of ways to choose 1 blue ball from 5: \( \binom{5}{1} \).

So, the number of favorable outcomes is \( \binom{3}{2} \times \binom{5}{1} \).

**Step 3: Compute the probability.**
Probability = (number of favorable outcomes) / (total number of outcomes)
$$
P = \frac{\binom{3}{2} \times \binom{5}{1}}{\binom{8}{3}}
$$

Now, let's compute the values:
- \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
- \( \binom{5}{1} = 5 \)
- \( \binom{8}{3} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56 \)

So,
$$
P = \frac{3 \times 5}{56} = \frac{15}{56} \approx 0.267857
$$

This matches your idea of multiplying by 3 (for the different orders) because:
- Your initial calculation for one specific order (red, red, blue) was:
  First red: \( \frac{3}{8} \), second red: \( \frac{2}{7} \) (since one red is gone), blue: \( \frac{5}{6} \) (since two balls are gone).
  So, \( \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{2}{7} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{30}{336} = \frac{5}{56} \approx 0.0892857 \).

But there are 3 different orders in which you can get 2 reds and 1 blue:
1. Red, Red, Blue
2. Red, Blue, Red
3. Blue, Red, Red

Each of these has the same probability (because the numerators just get rearranged):
For example, Red, Blue, Red: \( \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{5}{7} \times \frac{2}{6} = \frac{30}{336} = \frac{5}{56} \).

So, total probability = \( 3 \times \frac{5}{56} = \frac{15}{56} \approx 0.267857 \).

So, your intuition was correct! You just needed to account for the changing denominators (without replacement) and the different orders.

**Summary:**
The probability is \( \frac{15}{56} \), which is about 0.2679 or 26.79%.

This method using combinations is often called the "hypergeometric distribution", which is used when sampling without replacement. The general formula for exactly \( q \) red balls when drawing \( r \) balls without replacement from a total of \( N = n + m + k \) balls (with \( m \) red) is:
$$
P = \frac{\binom{m}{q} \binom{n + k}{r - q}}{\binom{N}{r}}
$$
In your case, \( k = 0 \), so it simplifies to \( \frac{\binom{m}{q} \binom{n}{r - q}}{\binom{N}{r}} \).

I hope this helps! Keep practicing—it'll come back to you. Feel free to ask if you have more questions!
