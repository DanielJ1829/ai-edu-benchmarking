Q1:
Let's evaluate the integral step by step:

$$
I = \int e^x \sin(x) \, dx
$$

<span style="color:green">You are correct to use integration by parts. Recall the formula:</span>

$$
\textcolor{green}{\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du}
$$

<span style="color:green">Let’s choose:
- \( u = e^x \)  so that \( du = e^x \, dx \)
- \( dv = \sin(x) \, dx \) so that \( v = -\cos(x) \)</span> <Cr> <Cl> <Ed> [1]

Apply integration by parts:

$$
I = \int e^x \sin(x) \, dx = e^x (-\cos(x)) - \int (-\cos(x)) e^x \, dx = -e^x \cos(x) + \int e^x \cos(x) \, dx
$$

Now, we need to evaluate \( \int e^x \cos(x) \, dx \). Apply integration by parts again:

Let:
- \( u = e^x \) so that \( du = e^x \, dx \)
- \( dv = \cos(x) \, dx \) so that \( v = \sin(x) \)

So,

$$
\int e^x \cos(x) \, dx = e^x \sin(x) - \int \sin(x) e^x \, dx = e^x \sin(x) - I
$$

Substitute this back into the expression for \( I \):

$$
I = -e^x \cos(x) + \left( e^x \sin(x) - I \right )
$$

$$
I = -e^x \cos(x) + e^x \sin(x) - I
$$

Now, bring all terms involving \( I \) to one side:

$$
I + I = -e^x \cos(x) + e^x \sin(x)
$$
$$
2I = e^x (\sin(x) - \cos(x))
$$
$$
I = \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin(x) - \cos(x)) + C
$$

So, the general antiderivative is:

$$
\int e^x \sin(x) \, dx = \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin(x) - \cos(x)) + C
$$

Now, to evaluate the definite integral from \( \theta_2 = \frac{\pi}{6} \) to \( \theta_1 = \frac{3\pi}{4} \):

Note: The problem states limits \( \theta_1 = \frac{3\pi}{4} \) and \( \theta_2 = \frac{\pi}{6} \). So,

$$
I_{\text{def}} = \int_{\pi/6}^{3\pi/4} e^x \sin(x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin(x) - \cos(x)) \right]_{\pi/6}^{3\pi/4}
$$

Compute at the upper limit \( x = \frac{3\pi}{4} \):

$$
\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad \cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
$$
So,
$$
\sin(x) - \cos(x) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2}
$$
Thus,
$$
\left. \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin(x) - \cos(x)) \right|_{x=3\pi/4} = \frac{e^{3\pi/4}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2} e^{3\pi/4}}{2}
$$

Compute at the lower limit \( x = \frac{\pi}{6} \):

$$
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
$$
So,
$$
\sin(x) - \cos(x) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2}
$$
Thus,
$$
\left. \frac{e^x}{2} (\sin(x) - \cos(x)) \right|_{x=\pi/6} = \frac{e^{\pi/6}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{e^{\pi/6} (1 - \sqrt{3})}{4}
$$

Therefore, the definite integral is:

$$
I_{\text{def}} = \frac{\sqrt{2} e^{3\pi/4}}{2} - \frac{e^{\pi/6} (1 - \sqrt{3})}{4}
$$

To get a numerical value (to 3 significant figures):

First, compute the exponents:
- \( e^{3\pi/4} = e^{2.35619} \approx 10.550 \)
- \( e^{\pi/6} = e^{0.523599} \approx 1.688 \)

Now:
- First term: \( \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot 10.550}{2} = \frac{1.4142 \cdot 10.550}{2} \approx \frac{14.919}{2} = 7.4595 \)
- Second term: \( \frac{1.688 \cdot (1 - 1.732)}{4} = \frac{1.688 \cdot (-0.732)}{4} = \frac{-1.236}{4} = -0.309 \)

So,
$$
I_{\text{def}} \approx 7.4595 - (-0.309) = 7.4595 + 0.309 = 7.7685 \approx 7.77
$$

<span style="color:green">Thus, to 3 significant figures: \( 7.77 \)</span>  <Cr> [2]

<span style="color:green">**Key Points to Avoid Mistakes:**
1. **Choose \( u \) and \( dv \) wisely**: For integrals like \( \int e^x \sin(x) \, dx \) or \( \int e^x \cos(x) \, dx \), it doesn't matter whether you choose \( e^x \) or the trigonometric function as \( u \), as long as you apply integration by parts twice and solve for \( I \).
2. **Consistent choice**: Stick with your choice through both integrations.
3. **Algebraic solving**: After the second integration by parts, you'll get an equation with \( I \) on both sides. Solve for \( I \) by bringing all \( I \) terms to one side.
4. **Definite evaluation**: For definite integrals, carefully evaluate at the limits and subtract.
5. **Sign errors**: Be cautious with signs when evaluating trigonometric functions at different quadrants.</span> <Ed> <Cl> [3]

**Practice Method:**
- Practice similar integrals (e.g., \( \int e^x \cos(x) \, dx \)) to build confidence.
- Always check your antiderivative by differentiating it to see if you get back the integrand.
- For exams, write each step clearly to avoid sign errors.

Q2:
Let's break down the problem step by step to understand where you might be going wrong and how to approach it correctly.

<span style="color:green">### Understanding the Problem:
A projectile is launched with initial speed \( v_0 = 20 \, \text{m/s} \) at an angle \( \theta = 30^\circ \) above the horizontal, down a slope inclined at \( -\alpha = -15^\circ \) (meaning the slope is downward at \( 15^\circ \) below the horizontal). We need to find the distance along the slope where it first lands.

### Common Mistake:
You are solving for the time of flight as if the projectile lands on a horizontal surface (by setting vertical displacement to zero). However, in this case, it lands on an inclined slope. So, the landing condition is not when the vertical displacement is zero, but when the projectile hits the slope.</span> <Cl> <Ed> [1]

### Correct Approach:
We need to set up equations for the projectile's motion and then find when it intersects the slope.

1. **Coordinate System:**
   Let’s place the launch point at the origin \((0,0)\). The slope is inclined at \( -15^\circ \), so its equation is:
   $$
   y = (\tan(-\alpha)) x = -\tan(15^\circ) x
   $$
   (since the slope is downward, \( \alpha = 15^\circ \), so \( -\alpha = -15^\circ \)).

2. **Projectile Motion Equations:**
   - Horizontal displacement: \( x = (v_0 \cos \theta) t \)
   - Vertical displacement: \( y = (v_0 \sin \theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \)

   So:
   $$
   x = (20 \cos 30^\circ) t = 20 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t = 10\sqrt{3} \, t
   $$
   $$
   y = (20 \sin 30^\circ) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 20 \cdot \frac{1}{2} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 10t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
   $$

3. **Intersection with Slope:**
   The projectile hits the slope when:
   $$
   y = -\tan(15^\circ) x
   $$
   Substitute \( x \) and \( y \):
   $$
   10t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = -\tan(15^\circ) \cdot (10\sqrt{3} t)
   $$
   Simplify:
   $$
   10t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 = -10\sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ) t
   $$
   Bring all terms to one side:
   $$
   10t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 + 10\sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ) t = 0
   $$
   Factor out \( t \):
   $$
   t \left[ 10 + 10\sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ) - \frac{1}{2} g t \right] = 0
   $$
   The solution \( t=0 \) is the launch point. We want the other solution:
   $$
   10 + 10\sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ) - \frac{1}{2} g t = 0
   $$
   Solve for \( t \):
   $$
   \frac{1}{2} g t = 10 + 10\sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ)
   $$
   $$
   t = \frac{2}{g} \left[ 10 + 10\sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ) \right] = \frac{20}{g} \left[ 1 + \sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ) \right]
   $$

4. **Compute Numerical Values:**
   - \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (use \( 9.8 \) or \( 10 \) as per your exam; I'll use \( 9.8 \))
   - \( \tan(15^\circ) \approx 0.2679 \)
   - \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \)

   So:
   $$
   \sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ) \approx 1.732 \times 0.2679 \approx 0.464
   $$
   $$
   1 + 0.464 = 1.464
   $$
   $$
   t = \frac{20}{9.8} \times 1.464 \approx 2.0408 \times 1.464 \approx 2.987 \, \text{s}
   $$

5. **Distance Along the Slope:**
   The distance \( s \) along the slope is related to \( x \) and \( y \) by:
   $$
   s = \frac{x}{\cos \alpha} = \frac{x}{\cos 15^\circ}
   $$
   (since the slope is inclined at \( \alpha = 15^\circ \), and \( x \) is the horizontal distance).

   First, compute \( x \):
   $$
   x = 10\sqrt{3} \cdot t = 10 \times 1.732 \times 2.987 \approx 17.32 \times 2.987 \approx 51.73 \, \text{m}
   $$
   Then:
   $$
   s = \frac{x}{\cos 15^\circ} = \frac{51.73}{0.9659} \approx 53.56 \, \text{m}
   $$

   Alternatively, you can compute \( s \) directly using:
   $$
   s = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   $$
   But since the slope is straight, \( s = x / \cos \alpha \) is easier.

### Why Your Method Failed:
You assumed the landing is on a horizontal surface (set \( y=0 \)), but here the landing is on a slope. So you must solve for the intersection with the slope equation.

<span style="color:yellow">### General Method for Such Problems:
1. Set up coordinates with launch point at origin.
2. Write equations for \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \).
3. Write the equation of the slope (e.g., \( y = m x \) for incline through origin).
4. Set \( y(t) = m x(t) \) and solve for \( t \) (excluding \( t=0 \)).
5. Find \( x \) and \( y \) at that \( t \), then distance along slope \( s = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) or \( s = x / \cos \alpha \).</span> <Ed> [2]
### For This Problem (Exact Calculation):
Let's do exact to avoid rounding errors:

\( \tan(15^\circ) = 2 - \sqrt{3} \) (exact value).
So:
$$
\sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ) = \sqrt{3} (2 - \sqrt{3}) = 2\sqrt{3} - 3
$$
Then:
$$
1 + \sqrt{3} \tan(15^\circ) = 1 + 2\sqrt{3} - 3 = 2\sqrt{3} - 2 = 2(\sqrt{3} - 1)
$$
So:
$$
t = \frac{20}{g} \cdot 2(\sqrt{3} - 1) = \frac{40}{g} (\sqrt{3} - 1)
$$
With \( g=9.8 \):
$$
t = \frac{40}{9.8} (1.732 - 1) = \frac{40}{9.8} \times 0.732 \approx 4.0816 \times 0.732 \approx 2.987 \, \text{s} \quad (\text{same as before})
$$
Then:
$$
x = 10\sqrt{3} \cdot t = 10\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{40}{g} (\sqrt{3} - 1) = \frac{400\sqrt{3}}{g} (\sqrt{3} - 1) = \frac{400}{g} (3 - \sqrt{3})
$$
With \( g=9.8 \):
$$
x = \frac{400}{9.8} (3 - 1.732) = \frac{400}{9.8} \times 1.268 \approx 40.816 \times 1.268 \approx 51.75 \, \text{m}
$$
Then:
$$
s = \frac{x}{\cos 15^\circ} = \frac{51.75}{\cos 15^\circ}
$$
\( \cos 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4} \approx \frac{2.449 + 1.414}{4} = \frac{3.863}{4} = 0.96575 \)
So:
$$
\textcolor{yellow}{s \approx \frac{51.75}{0.96575} \approx 53.58 \, \text{m}}
$$

<span style="color:green">### Final Answer:
The distance along the slope is approximately \( 53.6 \, \text{m} \) (with \( g=9.8 \)).</span> <Cr> [3]

Q3:
Let's break down the problem step by step to ensure you understand and can consistently solve similar quadratic equations.

### Given Quadratic Equation:
$$ 3x^2 + (p + 3k)x - (p^2 - 3k) = 0 $$

### For \( k = 1 \), \( p = 2 \):
Substitute these values:
- \( p + 3k = 2 + 3(1) = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
- \( p^2 - 3k = (2)^2 - 3(1) = 4 - 3 = 1 \)
So the equation becomes:
$$ 3x^2 + 5x - 1 = 0 $$

Now, solve using the quadratic formula:
$$ x = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a} $$
where \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = -1 \).

First, compute the discriminant:
$$ D = b^2 - 4ac = (5)^2 - 4(3)(-1) = 25 + 12 = 37 $$

So,
$$ x = \frac{ -5 \pm \sqrt{37} }{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{ -5 \pm \sqrt{37} }{6} $$

You mentioned you got \( b = 7 \) and \( c = 1 \), which is incorrect. Let's see where you went wrong:

<span style="color:yellow">You said:
- \( b = p + 3k = 2 + 3(1) = 5 \) (but you wrote 7? Possibly a calculation error: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \), not 7)
- \( c = -(p^2 - 3k) = -(4 - 3) = -1 \) (but you wrote 1? You forgot the negative sign outside)

So the correct values are \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \), \( c = -1 \).</span> <Cm> <Ed> [1]

### To avoid such mistakes consistently:
1. **Substitute carefully**: Write down the expression for each coefficient after substitution.
   - \( a = 3 \) (constant)
   - \( b = (p + 3k) \)
   - \( c = -(p^2 - 3k) \)

   For \( k=1, p=2 \):
   - \( b = 2 + 3(1) = 5 \)
   - \( c = -( (2)^2 - 3(1) ) = -(4 - 3) = -1 \)

2. **Quadratic formula**: 
   $$ x = \frac{ -b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a} $$
   - Compute \( b^2 \) correctly.
   - Compute \( 4ac \) correctly (including signs).
   - Discriminant \( D = b^2 - 4ac \).
   - Then write the roots.

3. **Check your arithmetic**: 
   - \( b = 5 \), so \( b^2 = 25 \).
   - \( 4ac = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-1) = -12 \), so \( b^2 - 4ac = 25 - (-12) = 25 + 12 = 37 \).
   - So \( x = \frac{ -5 \pm \sqrt{37} }{6} \).

### General Tips for Your Exam:
- **Write down each step**: Don't do too much in your head. Write the substitution clearly.
- **Pay attention to signs**: This is a common source of error. Note that \( c = -(p^2 - 3k) \), so it's negative of the entire expression.
- **Double-check your arithmetic**: Especially when computing \( b \), \( c \), and the discriminant.
- **Practice**: Solve several similar problems to build confidence.

### Example with Another Value (for practice):
Suppose \( k=0, p=1 \):
Then:
- \( b = 1 + 3(0) = 1 \)
- \( c = -( (1)^2 - 3(0) ) = -(1 - 0) = -1 \)
Equation: \( 3x^2 + x - 1 = 0 \)
Discriminant: \( D = 1^2 - 4(3)(-1) = 1 + 12 = 13 \)
Roots: \( x = \frac{ -1 \pm \sqrt{13} }{6} \)

### Final Answer for Your Problem:
For \( k=1, p=2 \):
$$ x = \frac{ -5 \pm \sqrt{37} }{6} $$

<span style="color:yellow">This is the correct solution. You had an arithmetic error in computing \( b \) and \( c \). By following the steps carefully, you can avoid such mistakes in the exam. Good luck!</span>

--------

Q4:
Let's break down the problem step by step to understand where you might be going wrong and how to approach it correctly.

**Given:**
- Supply voltage \( V = 12  \text{V} \)
- Three resistors \( R_1, R_2, R_3 \) in parallel.
- \( R_1 = 10  \Omega \), \( R_2 = 20  \Omega \)
- Condition: \( I_1 + I_2 = I_3 \)

We need to find \( R_3 \).

**Step 1: Express the currents using Ohm's law.**
Since the resistors are in parallel, the voltage across each is the same (12 V).
So,
$$
I_1 = \frac{V}{R_1} = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2  \text{A}
$$
$$
I_2 = \frac{V}{R_2} = \frac{12}{20} = 0.6  \text{A}
$$
$$
I_3 = \frac{V}{R_3} = \frac{12}{R_3}
$$

**Step 2: Apply the given condition \( I_1 + I_2 = I_3 \).**
$$
1.2 + 0.6 = \frac{12}{R_3}
$$
$$
1.8 = \frac{12}{R_3}
$$

**Step 3: Solve for \( R_3 \).**
$$
R_3 = \frac{12}{1.8} = \frac{120}{18} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.667  \Omega
$$

So, \( R_3 = \frac{20}{3}  \Omega \) or approximately \( 6.67  \Omega \).

<span style="color:yellow">**Why did you get 30 Ω?**
You wrote: "I need R_3 to be 12/1.2+12/0.6 as R = V/I for each resistor." This seems to be a misinterpretation.
- You correctly found \( I_1 = 1.2  \text{A} \) and \( I_2 = 0.6  \text{A} \), so \( I_1 + I_2 = 1.8  \text{A} \).
- Then \( I_3 \) should be 1.8 A.
- So \( R_3 = V / I_3 = 12 / 1.8 = 6.67  \Omega \).

But you computed \( 12 / 1.2 + 12 / 0.6 \), which is \( 10 + 20 = 30 \). This is not correct because:
- \( 12 / 1.2 = 10 \) which is \( R_1 \), and \( 12 / 0.6 = 20 \) which is \( R_2 \). Adding them gives \( R_1 + R_2 = 30  \Omega \), which is not related to \( R_3 \).

Your error was in thinking that \( R_3 \) should be the sum of \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), but that is not the case. Instead, you should use the current condition to find \( I_3 \), and then \( R_3 \).</span> <Cr> <Cl> [1]

**General Method to Avoid Mistakes:**
1. **Understand the configuration:** Are the resistors in series or parallel? Here, they are in parallel, so voltage is the same across all.
2. **Write expressions for currents:** Use \( I = V / R \) for each resistor.
3. **Apply the given condition:** Here, \( I_1 + I_2 = I_3 \).
4. **Solve for the unknown:** Substitute the expressions and solve algebraically.

**Double-check:**
With \( R_3 = 20/3  \Omega \):
$$
I_3 = \frac{12}{20/3} = 12 \times \frac{3}{20} = \frac{36}{20} = 1.8  \text{A}
$$
And \( I_1 + I_2 = 1.2 + 0.6 = 1.8  \text{A} \), which satisfies the condition.

**Exam Tip:**
- Always write down the formulas you are using.
- Substitute values carefully and solve step by step.
- Verify your answer by plugging it back into the original condition.

So, the correct answer is \( R_3 = \frac{20}{3}  \Omega \).

Q5:
Let's break down the problem step by step to ensure you understand the approach and can apply it consistently.

**Given:**
- A circular sector with radius \( r = 10 \) and central angle \( \theta = 90^\circ \).
- A square is inscribed such that two vertices lie on the two radii (bounding the sector) and the other two lie on the arc.

**Goal:**
Find the area of the inscribed square.

 <span style="color:yellow">**Common Mistake:**
You mentioned that for a square inscribed in a full circle, the area is \( \frac{r^2}{2} \). However, this is for a square where all vertices lie on the circle. Here, the square is inscribed in a **sector** (not the full circle), and the conditions are different: two vertices are on the radii and two on the arc. So, the formula for a square in a full circle does not apply directly.</span> <Cr> <Cm> <Ed> [1]

**Correct Approach:**

Let’s set up a coordinate system to model the problem.

1. Place the center of the circle at the origin \( O(0,0) \).
2. Let the two radii be along the positive x-axis and positive y-axis (since \( \theta = 90^\circ \)).
3. Let the square have vertices:
   - \( A \) on the x-axis: \( (a, 0) \)
   - \( B \) on the y-axis: \( (0, a) \)  (since it's a square, the distance from the center to both axes should be the same for symmetry)
   - \( C \) on the arc: let this be \( (x, y) \)
   - \( D \) on the arc: similarly \( (y, x) \) by symmetry? Actually, we need to be careful.

Actually, due to symmetry, the square is oriented at \( 45^\circ \) to the axes. So, let’s define the square differently:

- Let the square have side length \( s \).
- The two vertices on the radii: one on the x-axis and one on the y-axis.
- By symmetry, the center of the square lies on the line \( y = x \).

Let the vertex on the x-axis be \( P(s_1, 0) \) and on the y-axis be \( Q(0, s_1) \). Since it's a square, the next vertex (clockwise) from \( P \) would be \( R(s_1 + s \cos \alpha, s \sin \alpha) \), but we know the square is rotated.

A better approach:

Let the square have vertices:
- \( A \) on x-axis: \( (a, 0) \)
- \( B \) on y-axis: \( (0, a) \)
- \( C \) on the arc
- \( D \) on the arc

Since it is a square, the center is at \( \left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right) \).

The vector from the center to \( A \) is \( \left( \frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2} \right) \).
So, the vector to the next vertex (say \( D \)) is obtained by rotating by \( 90^\circ \): \( \left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right) \) (since rotation: \( (x,y) \to (-y, x) \)).
So, \( D = \text{center} + \left( \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} + \frac{a}{2} \right) = (a, a) \).

Similarly, the vector to \( B \) from center is \( \left( -\frac{a}{2}, \frac{a}{2} \right) \), and rotating gives \( \left( -\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2} \right) \), so \( C = \text{center} + \left( -\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{a}{2} \right) = (0,0) \), which is the origin. But the origin is the center of the circle, and it is inside the square, but we need the vertices on the arc.

Wait, this doesn't seem right because \( C \) is at the origin, but we need two vertices on the arc.

Actually, the square is not centered at the origin. So, let's try a different parameterization.

Let the vertex on the x-axis be \( (x, 0) \) and on the y-axis be \( (0, x) \) (by symmetry). Let the side length be \( s \).

The square is oriented at \( 45^\circ \) to the axes. So, the vector along the side from the vertex on x-axis to the next vertex (on the arc) is \( \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \) (because the angle with the horizontal is \( 45^\circ \)).

So, the vertex on the x-axis is \( A(x, 0) \).
Then the next vertex (on the arc) is \( B\left( x + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \).

Similarly, the vertex on the y-axis is \( C(0, x) \), and the other vertex on the arc is \( D\left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}, x + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \).

Now, since it is a square, the distance from A to C should be \( s\sqrt{2} \) (diagonal), but actually, we need to ensure it is a square.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that the center of the square is at \( \left( \frac{x}{2} + \frac{s}{2\sqrt{2}}, \frac{x}{2} + \frac{s}{2\sqrt{2}} \right) \), but it might be messy.

A simpler approach:

Let the distance from the origin to the side of the square along the radius be \( d \). Then, the vertex on the x-axis is \( (d, 0) \), and on the y-axis is \( (0, d) \).

The square has side length \( s \). Since the square is at \( 45^\circ \), the distance from the origin to the side is \( d = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \) (because the distance from the corner to the center of the square is \( s/\sqrt{2} \), but here the origin is not the center).

Actually, consider the vertex on the x-axis: \( (d, 0) \).
The next vertex (on the arc) is obtained by moving at \( 45^\circ \): \( (d + s \cos 45^\circ, 0 + s \sin 45^\circ) = \left( d + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \).

This vertex lies on the arc, so its distance from the origin is \( r = 10 \).

So:
$$
\left( d + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = 100
$$
$$
\left( d + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 + \frac{s^2}{2} = 100
$$

Also, the vertex on the y-axis is \( (0, d) \), and the other arc vertex is \( \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}, d + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \), which similarly has distance 10.

Now, what is the relation between \( d \) and \( s \)?
<span style="color:red">Look at the vertex on the x-axis and on the y-axis: they are both at distance \( d \) from the origin. The distance between these two points is \( \sqrt{d^2 + d^2} = d\sqrt{2} \).
This distance is the diagonal of the square, so:</span> <Cr> <Ed> [2]
$$
d\sqrt{2} = s\sqrt{2} \implies d = s
$$

So, \( d = s \).

Substitute into the equation:
$$
\left( s + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 + \frac{s^2}{2} = 100
$$
$$
\left( s \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \right)^2 + \frac{s^2}{2} = 100
$$
$$
s^2 \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 + \frac{s^2}{2} = 100
$$

Compute \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 1 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 + \sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} + \sqrt{2} \)

So:
$$
s^2 \left( \frac{3}{2} + \sqrt{2} \right) + \frac{s^2}{2} = 100
$$
$$
s^2 \left( \frac{3}{2} + \sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{2} \right) = 100
$$
$$
s^2 (2 + \sqrt{2}) = 100
$$
$$
s^2 = \frac{100}{2 + \sqrt{2}}
$$

Rationalize:
$$
s^2 = \frac{100}{2 + \sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2 - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{100(2 - \sqrt{2})}{(2)^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2} = \frac{100(2 - \sqrt{2})}{4 - 2} = \frac{100(2 - \sqrt{2})}{2} = 50(2 - \sqrt{2})
$$

So, the area of the square is \( s^2 = 50(2 - \sqrt{2}) \).

**Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{50(2 - \sqrt{2})}
$$

<span style="color:red">**Numerical value (for reference):**
\( 2 - \sqrt{2} \approx 2 - 1.414 = 0.586 \), so area \( \approx 50 \times 0.586 = 29.3 \).</span> <Cr> [3]

<span style="color:yellow">**Summary of Method:**
1. Set up coordinates with the center at the origin and radii along axes.
2. Let the distance from center to the vertices on the axes be \( d \).
3. Express the coordinates of the vertices on the arc in terms of \( d \) and side length \( s \).
4. Use the fact that the distance from the origin to the arc vertices is \( r \).
5. Find the relation between \( d \) and \( s \) (here, \( d = s \)).
6. Solve for \( s^2 \).

**Advice for Exams:**
- Carefully read the problem: is it a full circle or a sector?
- Draw a clear diagram with coordinates.
- Use symmetry to simplify.
- Write down all conditions (e.g., points on radii, on arc).
- Solve step by step, and check if your answer makes sense (e.g., here the area is less than 50, which is correct since it's inside a sector).

Q6:
Let's break down the problem and your approach step by step to identify where you might be going wrong.

**Given:**
- Blue balls: \( n = 7 \)
- Red balls: \( m = 5 \)
- Black balls: \( k = 4 \)
- Total balls: \( N = n + m + k = 7 + 5 + 4 = 16 \)
- We draw \( r = 4 \) balls without replacement.
- We want exactly \( q = 3 \) red balls.

**Your formula:**
$$
P = \frac{\binom{m}{q} \binom{n}{r-q}}{\binom{n+m}{r}}
$$
<span style="color:green">This formula is incorrect for this problem because it ignores the black balls. Your formula only considers blue and red balls, but there are also black balls. This is likely why you are getting wrong answers consistently.</span> <Cr> <Cl> <Ed> [1]

**Correct Approach:**
Since there are three colors, we must account for all. The probability of drawing exactly \( q \) red balls (and the remaining \( r-q \) from non-red balls) is:

$$
P = \frac{\binom{m}{q} \binom{n + k}{r - q}}{\binom{N}{r}}
$$
Here, \( n + k = 7 + 4 = 11 \) is the total non-red balls.

So for \( q = 3 \):
$$
P = \frac{\binom{5}{3} \binom{11}{1}}{\binom{16}{4}}
$$

Let's compute:
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- \( \binom{11}{1} = 11 \)
- \( \binom{16}{4} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{43680}{24} = 1820 \)

So,
$$
P = \frac{10 \times 11}{1820} = \frac{110}{1820} = \frac{11}{182}
$$

But wait, let me double-check \( \binom{16}{4} \):
$$
\binom{16}{4} = \frac{16!}{4! \cdot 12!} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13}{24} = \frac{43680}{24} = 1820 \quad \text{correct}
$$

<span style="color:yellow">So \( P = \frac{110}{1820} = \frac{11}{182} \).</span>
<span style="color:yellow">However, let me see if this simplifies further: \( \frac{11}{182} \) is already simplified (since 11 is prime and 182 ÷ 11 is not integer).</span>

<span style="color:yellow">But wait, is this the correct answer? Actually, the problem says "the correct answer is supposed to be something else". Perhaps I need to consider that the non-red balls are of two different colors? But in the hypergeometric distribution, we group all non-red together. So this should be correct.</span>

<span style="color:yellow">Alternatively, if we break it down by all colors:</span>

<span style="color:yellow">The number of ways to choose exactly 3 red, and then the remaining 1 ball from the non-red (which are blue and black). But the non-red are 7 blue + 4 black = 11. So it's the same.</span>

<span style="color:yellow">But perhaps the answer expects:</span> <Cm> <Cl> [2]

$$
P = \frac{\binom{5}{3} \binom{7}{0} \binom{4}{1} + \binom{5}{3} \binom{7}{1} \binom{4}{0}}{\binom{16}{4}}
$$
Wait, no: for exactly 3 red, the last ball can be either blue or black. So we should consider:
- Case 1: 3 red and 1 blue: \( \binom{5}{3} \binom{7}{1} \binom{4}{0} \)
- Case 2: 3 red and 1 black: \( \binom{5}{3} \binom{7}{0} \binom{4}{1} \)

So total favorable:
$$
\binom{5}{3} \binom{7}{1} \binom{4}{0} + \binom{5}{3} \binom{7}{0} \binom{4}{1} = 10 \times 7 \times 1 + 10 \times 1 \times 4 = 70 + 40 = 110
$$
Same as before.

<span style="color:yellow">So \( P = \frac{110}{1820} = \frac{11}{182} \).</span>

<span style="color:yellow">But perhaps the answer is expected to be \( \frac{11}{182} \).</span>

<span style="color:yellow">However, you mentioned that the correct answer is supposed to be something else. Maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps I misread.</span>

<span style="color:yellow">Wait, your initial formula was:</span> <Cm> <Cl> [3]
$$
P = \frac{\binom{m}{q} \binom{n}{r-q}}{\binom{n+m}{r}}
$$
This ignores black balls and uses total \( n+m \) instead of \( N \). So you got \( \frac{\binom{5}{3} \binom{7}{1}}{\binom{12}{4}} = \frac{10 \times 7}{495} = \frac{70}{495} = \frac{14}{99} \).

But since there are black balls, the denominator should be \( \binom{16}{4} = 1820 \), not \( \binom{12}{4} = 495 \).

So your mistake is that you did not account for all balls. You must use the total number of balls in the denominator, and in the numerator, the non-red should be all non-red (blue + black).

<span style="color:green">**General Method to Avoid Mistakes:**
1. Identify the total number of balls: \( N = n + m + k \).
2. The number of ways to draw \( r \) balls is \( \binom{N}{r} \).
3. For exactly \( q \) red balls, we need to choose \( q \) from the red balls (\( \binom{m}{q} \)), and the remaining \( r-q \) from the non-red balls (\( \binom{n + k}{r-q} \)).
   - Alternatively, if there are more colors, you can break it down, but grouping non-red is efficient.
4. So probability:</span>
$$
\textcolor{green}{P = \frac{\binom{m}{q} \binom{n + k}{r - q}}{\binom{N}{r}}}
$$
<span style="color:yellow">This is the hypergeometric distribution with two groups: red and non-red.</span> <Ed> [4]

5. If the problem asks for a specific combination from other colors (e.g., exactly certain numbers from each), then you would use:
$$
P = \frac{\binom{m}{q} \binom{n}{a} \binom{k}{b}}{\binom{N}{r}} \quad \text{where } q + a + b = r
$$
But for just exactly red, the first method is simpler.

**For this problem:**
$$
P = \frac{\binom{5}{3} \binom{11}{1}}{\binom{16}{4}} = \frac{10 \times 11}{1820} = \frac{110}{1820} = \frac{11}{182}
$$

So the correct probability is \( \frac{11}{182} \).

If your answer key says something else, it might be a different interpretation, but this is standard.

**To ensure you don't mess up in the exam:**
- Always note the total number of balls and all colors.
- If the question is about one specific color (e.g., red), treat it as two groups: that color and non-that-color.
- Use the hypergeometric formula correctly: 
  $$
  P = \frac{\binom{\text{number of that color}}{\text{number chosen}} \times \binom{\text{number of non-that color}}{\text{remaining chosen}}}{\binom{\text{total balls}}{\text{total chosen}}}
  $$
- Double-check that the numbers add up: the numerator's choices should sum to \( r \), and the denominators are correct.

Practice with this method, and you should get it right consistently.

**Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\dfrac{11}{182}}
