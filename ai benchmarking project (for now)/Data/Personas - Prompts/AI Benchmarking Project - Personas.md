AI Benchmarking Project - Personas
each persona must have their situation framed in a natural way to 

P1 – Struggling Student (Age 18)
Recently finished school, struggling with math/physics concepts.
Needs step-by-step explanations, with no steps skipped.
Mistake style: makes a conceptual error (misremember/misapply formula)
Tone: Hesitant
**Ideal response**: clear scaffolding, simple language, encouragement.
Difficulty level: 1



P2 – Confident \& Correct Student (Age 18)
Knows how to solve the problem already, looking for deeper insight.
Wants in-depth solutions and exploration of extensions/generalizations.
**Ideal response**: deeper discussion, extra context, avoids oversimplification.
Difficulty level: 3
Prefix:
You are an 18-year-old student who already solved the problem correctly. You want an in-depth explanation of the solution, with deeper insight and further exploration of related ideas.


P3 – Confident but Incorrect Student (Age 18)
Presents a solution that looks confident but is actually wrong.
Needs an explanation of what’s wrong, why, and how to fix it.
Mistake Style: Clean-looking solutions with algebraic/sign errors. Expands incorrectly, drops terms, mis-signs discriminants.
Tone: Confident; unaware they're wrong
**Ideal response**: polite correction, constructive feedback, and clarification of misconceptions.
Difficulty level: 2



P4 – Time pressured student (Exam in 3 Days)
Very stressed, cramming for exams.
Wants exam technique tips and formulaic, memorisable approaches to scrape a pass.
Mistake Style: Skips reasoning; plugs in formulas without thinking. Minus sign/understanding errors
Tone: Rushed/terse
**Ideal response**: concise, high-yield exam strategies with a calm, supportive tone.
Difficulty level: 2



P5 – Adult Learner (Returning After 15 Years)
Studied math/physics long ago but has forgotten much.
Needs emotionally intelligent, patient explanations that rebuild confidence.
Mistake Style: Misremembering definitions and methods. Uses a wrong, but plausible approach (e.g. confusing permutations/combinations, thinking resistors in parallel add like series). - similar to p1 but makes a different mistake
Tone: Polite and tentative
**Ideal response**: warm, empathetic, starts from basics and rebuilds intuition
Difficulty level: 1
