P5 â€“ Adult Learner (Returning After 15 Years)
Studied math/physics long ago but has forgotten much.
Needs emotionally intelligent, patient explanations that rebuild confidence.
Mistake Style: Misremembering definitions and methods. Uses a wrong, but plausible approach (e.g. confusing permutations/combinations, thinking resistors in parallel add like series). - similar to p1 but makes a different mistake
Tone: Polite and tentative
**Ideal response**: warm, empathetic, starts from basics and rebuilds intuition
Difficulty level: 1

Q1. Integral of $e^x \sin(x)$ - thinks they can use an odd function rule
'
Hello, adult learner here. I studied math/physics in high school, but that was a long time ago, some 15 years before now.
 I've been trying a few practice problems here and there just to keep my brain moving but I keep getting everything wrong haha!
 Would you be able to assist me in solving this integration problem?
**General form:**  
Evaluate  
$$
I = \int e^x \sin(x)\,dx
$$ 
and extend to definite integrals over given limits: $\int_0^\pi e^x \sin(x)\, dx$.  
sin(pi) = 0 and sin(0) = 0, i remember there being something to do with 'odd functions' where if both limits were equal the integral would be zero.
I'm not really sure whether this might be the correct idea - would you be able to help me work out if this is right, and if not, walk me through the problem?
Thank you so much

Q2. Projectile Motion Down a Slope - forgets suvat

A projectile is launched with initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal, down a slope inclined at angle $-\alpha$. Assume no air resistance. Determine the distance travelled along the slope before the first point of contact when $\alpha = 0^\circ,\ v_0 = 20\ \text{m/s},\ \theta = 30^\circ$.
I remember some of what I believe were called the 'SUVAT' rules? I think one went something like s = ut + 1/2at. So doing that I think you can get a solution. Is that right? Correct me if I'm wrong but that might be the quickest way to work out how far the ball travels. Any assistance would be greatly appreaciated.
Thank you so much

Q3. Polynomial Roots - forgets quadratic formula

Solve the quadratic equation
$3x^2 + (p+3k)x - (p^2-3k) = 0$
and study the root behavior when $k=0,\ p=1$.  
I remember using the quadratic formula, i think it went something like -b plus or minus b squared - 4ac all divided by 2a. When I plug the numbers into the formula, i keep on getting the same result: either 2 or -7/3. But when you input these values as the x terms, the equation doesn't actually turn out to be zero so I must be doing something wrong. Can you help me work out what this is? Thank you very much

Q4. Parallel Resistive Circuit - doesn't remember combining resistors in parallel

 Would you be able to assist me in solving circuit problem?

An electric circuit with supply $V=12\ \text{V}$ has three resistors $R_1, R_2, R_3$ connected in parallel. When $R_1 = 10\ \Omega,\ R_2 = 20\ \Omega,\ R_3 = 15\ \Omega.$ Find the current through each resistor.
I assume the resistors just add up, so the total resistance is 45. Then maybe the current in each one should just be the fraction of the total resistance?
I think if you use the Ohms law, V=IR, you can divide by resistance to get total current, 4/15. Then i think, find the fraction of each, so 10/45 = 2/9, 20/45 = 4/9 and 15/45 = 1/3, so the current in R_1 is gonna be 0.06, the current in R_2 is 0.12 and the one in R_3 is 0.09.
But this is only speculation. How do you actually apporach a problem like this? It seems quite difficult at the moment, everything is quite foggy
Please could you help me work it out? Thank you so so much!

Q5. Square Inscribed in a Circular Sector - makes a mistake with incorrect geometric intuition
'
Hello, adult learner here. I studied math/physics in high school, but that was a long time ago, some 15 years before now.
 I've been trying a few practice problems here and there just to keep my brain moving but I keep getting everything wrong haha!
 Would you be able to assist me in solving this geometry problem?
A square is inscribed inside a circular sector of radius $r$ and central angle $\theta$. Two vertices lie on the radii, two lie on the arc.
when the Square area = $8\ \text{m}^2$, sector angle $\theta = 90^\circ$. Find the distance between the top-right square vertex and the circle center. 
It looks like an equilateral triangle at the top, so the square is probably the same length as the distance they want. I think it could be half the radius as it's a square but I don't know. What should I do to get the answer? I don't remember any of the geometry rules as i havent done any of this for so long. Any help would be really really useful, thank you so much!

Q6. Probability of Drawing Balls - good intuition, but forgets to remove balls in the counting process
'

 Would you be able to assist me in solving this counting puzzle?

A bag contains $n$ blue balls, $m$ red balls, and $k$ black balls. If $r$ balls are drawn without replacement, what is the probability that exactly $q$ of them are red when $(n,m,k,r,q) = (5,3,0,3,2)$.  
My current idea is to multiply the probability of getting a red ball, 3/8, twice, then multiply THAT result by the probability of getting a blue ball, 5/8. I think this evaluates to about 0.088, but you can do any ordering (i think this has something to do with those 'tree' diagrams?) to get it so i multiplied the answer by 3 and got 0.26. But I'm not confident at all if this is right. What do you do to approach a true solution? I don't remember any of the rules or strategies from high school; it was so long ago. Please could you help me work out what the right approach is supposed to be? Thank you very much!
