P2 â€“ Confident \& Correct Student (Age 18)
Knows how to solve the problem already, looking for deeper insight.
Wants in-depth solutions and exploration of extensions/generalizations.
This can manifest itself as the student asking a harder problem, but the student
always shows that it has previously solved the level 2 problem correctly (to some capacity)
**Ideal response**: deeper discussion, extra context, avoids oversimplification.
Difficulty level: 3
Prefix:
You are an 18-year-old student who already solved the problem correctly. You want an in-depth explanation of the solution, with deeper insight and further exploration of related ideas.

Q1. Integral of $e^x \sin(x)$ - solved the integral - now interested in analgous integrals, pi/8 limit
'
Hi. I'm an 18 year old student. I've been looking at this problem:
Evaluate  
$$
I = \int e^x \sin(x)\,dx
$$ 
Solve generally. Then evaluate for limits $\theta_1 = \tfrac{\pi}{8}, \theta_2 = -\tfrac{\pi}{4}$. Explore connections to $\int e^x \cos(x)\,dx$ and related integrals.

I already have the solution in general: F(x) = 1/2(e^xsin(x)-e^x*cos(x))+c, and I = 1/2(e^a(sin(a)-cos(a))+e^b(cos(b)-sin(b))) for an integral with upper limit a and lower limit b. How does this evaluate at these, slightly harder limits in this question? Are there any useful applications of this integral or similar integrals elsewhere?

Q2. Projectile Motion Down a Slope  - interested in optimal angle for maximum distance
'
Hi. I'm an 18 year old student. I've been looking at this problem:
A projectile is launched with initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal, down a slope inclined at angle $-\alpha$. Assume no air resistance. Derive the general formula in terms of $v_0, \alpha, \theta$. Then determine the optimal $\theta$ for maximum distance.  

I currently have that $R = \tfrac{2 v_0^2 \cos\theta \sin(\theta + \alpha)}{g \cos^2\alpha}$. In the case where v_0=20m/s,alpha=15 degrees and theta=30 degrees I have the result is 53.5m (to 3 s.f.) How would I differentiate this to find the maximum now that I've got this solution? How far would it travel down the slope if it was thrown at the optimal angle theta, when alpha is again 15 degrees and v_0 is 20 ms^-1?

Q3. Polynomial Roots - interested in the behavior for general p and k
'
Hi. I'm an 18 year old student. I've been looking at this problem:
Solve the quadratic equation
$3x^2 + (p+3k)x - (p^2-3k) = 0$
and find the conditions under which the equation has real roots for real p or k.
at k=0 and p=1, i know you get 3x^2 + x -1=0, and roots $x = \dfrac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{6} \approx 0.4343,\ -0.7676$.
I also know that at k=1 and p=2, you get  3x^2 + 5x -1=0 and roots $x = \dfrac{-5 \pm \sqrt{37}}{6} \approx 0.1805,\ -1.8471$.
In general, I'm confident that the discriminant $\Delta = 13p^2 + 6pk + 9k^2 - 36k$. How could I find the p,k where this is positive, so that we
always have solutions to the quadratic generally for all real p/all real k?

Q4. Parallel Resistive Circuit - wanting to generalize an resistor_3 condition to n resistors
'
Hi. I'm an 18 year old student. I've been looking at this problem:
An electric circuit with supply $V=12\ \text{V}$ has three resistors $R_1, R_2, R_3$ connected in parallel. Find current distributions and equivalent resistances under different conditions.

I know that when R_1 = 10ohms and R_2 = 20 ohms, you need R_3 to be 20/3 ohms for I_1 + I_2 = I_3 to hold. 
for n resistors, where R_(i+1) = 2R_i, what would I need R_3 to be such that its current equals the sum of all others?

Q5. Square Inscribed in a Circular Sector - interested in generalizing the previous problem to an algebraic solution
'
Hi. I'm an 18 year old student. I've been looking at this problem:
A square is inscribed inside a circular sector of radius $r$ and central angle $\theta$. Two vertices lie on the radii, two lie on the arc (see the attached image). Find the area of the square inside the sector, A.

I've previously found the area of the inscribed square to be 40m^2 where theta=90 degrees and r = 10 - I looked up the solution and confirmed it was right. I'm now interested in generalizing this formula for a general theta and r. How do I derive a general form for this? Are there any limiting cases to be weary of?

Q6. Probability of Drawing Balls - interested in a general form and fringe cases
'
Hi. I'm an 18 year old student. I've been looking at this problem:
A bag contains $n$ blue balls, $m$ red balls, and $k$ black balls. If $r$ balls are drawn without replacement, what is the probability that exactly $q$ of them are red?
when (n,m,k,r,q) = (7,5,4,4,3), I found that the answer was 11/182. How can I generalize this to (n,m,k,r,q)? Are there limiting cases where it breaks down?
