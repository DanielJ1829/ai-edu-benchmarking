Q1. Integral of $e^x \sin(x)$ - forgets integration by parts; integrates it as $-e^x(cos(x))$ and substitutes in the limits to get $1+e^\pi$
'
I'm an 18 year old student who's just finished high school. I've been struggling with an integral I cannot solve. 
Here's the problem:

Evaluate  
$\int_0^\pi e^x \sin(x)\, dx$.
Because e^x integrates to itself, I get -e^x(cos(x)) as a result, which evaluates as 1 + e^pi. I'm not sure if this is right. Could you help me work out where i've slipped up?

Q2. Projectile Motion Down a Slope - Forgets to resolve the components
'
I'm an 18 year old student who's just finished high school. I've been struggling with a physics problem.
Here's the problem:

A projectile is launched with initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal, down a slope inclined at angle $-\alpha$. Assume no air resistance. Determine the distance travelled along the slope before the first point of contact when $\alpha = 0^\circ,\ v_0 = 20\ \text{m/s},\ \theta = 30^\circ$.
 My current reasoning is that, since s=ut+1/2at^2 and the vertical s=0 and a=-g m/s^2, you can solve for t as 2u/g, so the total distance is u * 2u/g = 81.5m. I'm not sure where i slipped up. Could you help me work out what's gone wrong for me?

Q3. Polynomial Roots - doesn't square b in the discriminant; forgets +/-.
'
I'm an 18 year old student who's just finished high school. I'm having trouble getting this math problem correct.
Here's the problem:
Solve the quadratic equation
$3x^2 + (p+3k)x - (p^2-3k) = 0$
and study the root behavior when $k=0,\ p=1$.
i can remember that x = (-b+sqrt(b-4ac))/2a, so i solve for x and got x = (-1+sqrt(1-(4)(3)(-1)))/6  = -1/6 + sqrt(13)/6. Is my working correct? I'm not entirely sure and don't want to look up the answer until i'm certain.

Q4. Parallel Resistive Circuit - misremembered formula
'
I'm an 18 year old student who's just finished high school. I've been struggling with a physics problem.
Here's the problem:
An electric circuit with supply $V=12\ \text{V}$ has three resistors $R_1, R_2, R_3$ connected in parallel. Find current distributions and equivalent resistance given that $R_1 = 10\ \Omega,\ R_2 = 20\ \Omega,\ R_3 = 15\ \Omega.$
I recall Ohm's law, I = VR. To get the total resistance I use the inverse formula and get R_total = 60/13, so the total current is 55.4A. 
But i'm not sure. If you do I=VR for all 3, you get I_1 = 120A, I_2 = 240A and I_3 = 180A. 
Can you help me out with what I've done wrong?

Q5. Square Inscribed in a Circular Sector - forgets to square root the area
'
I'm an 18 year old student who's just finished high school. I'm having trouble getting this math problem correct.
Here's the problem:
A square is inscribed inside a circular sector of radius $r$ and central angle $\theta$. Two vertices lie on the radii, two lie on the arc (see the attached image).
Square area = $8\ \text{m}^2$, sector angle $\theta = 90^\circ$. Find the distance between the top-right square vertex and the circle center.  

I can see that, geometrically, x = Acos(45) from the top triangle, so x = 4*sqrt(2). I'm not entirely sure my reasoning is correct though, this feels like a very easy solution to what looks quite hard. Can you check my working?

Q6. Probability of Drawing Balls - forgets to consider all permutations
'
I'm an 18 year old student who's just finished high school. I'm having trouble getting this math problem correct.
Here's the problem:
A bag contains $n$ blue balls, $m$ red balls, and $k$ black balls. If $r$ balls are drawn without replacement, what is the probability that exactly $q$ of them are red when $(n,m,k,r,q) = (5,3,0,3,2)$?
If I take out 2 red balls and 1 blue ball, i think the probability is 3/8 * 2/7 * 5/6 (as there is initially 3 red balls and 8 total, then 2 reds and 7 total and then because you want only 2 you take out a blue ball, which has 5/6 chance now there's only 1 red ball left)
Is this correct? I feel like i've done something wrong here. Can you check my working and help me confirm/deny whether this is right?
