Q1. Integral of $e^x \sin(x)$ - applies formula incorrectly
'
I'm an 18 student studying for my exams my next math exam is in 3 days and I need to know how to solve this integral, what am I doing wrong??
Evaluate  
$$
I = \int e^x \sin(x)\,dx
$$ 
Find the general antiderivative, then evaluate for limits $\theta_1 = \tfrac{3\pi}{4}, \theta_2 = \tfrac{\pi}{6}$.
I choose u = e^x and v = sin(x) as it's integration by parts. This goes to [e^xsin(x)]-int(e^xsinx)dx, so the solution is 1/2[e^xsinx] which gives you about 0.209 to 3sf. I keep getting these questions wrong, how do I actually get this right consistently? What method do I need to use to ensure i dont mess the exam up?

Q2. Projectile Motion Down a Slope - applies formulas incorrectly to downward slope problem
'
I'm an 18 student studying for my exams my next physics exam is in 3 days and I need to know how to solve this, what am I doing wrong??
A projectile is launched with initial speed $v_0$ at an angle $\theta$ above the horizontal, down a slope inclined at angle $-\alpha$. Assume no air resistance. Determine the distance travelled along the slope before the first point of contact. when $\alpha = 15^\circ,\ v_0 = 20\ \text{m/s},\ \theta = 30^\circ$.  
Youre supposed solve the quadratic for t with the velocity * sin(theta), and I get s = 0 = 20sin(30)t - 0.5g*t^2 so t = 40sin(30)/g. When you multiply that time by horizontal speed which is supposed to be 20cos(30) you get 20(40)(sin30)(cos30)/g = 35.3.

Q3. Polynomial Roots - applies quadratic formula incorrectly, forgetting that a isnt always 1. Computes b and c incorrectly
'
I'm an 18 student studying for my exams my next math exam is in 3 days and I need to know how to solve this, what am I doing wrong??
Solve the quadratic equation
$3x^2 + (p+3k)x - (p^2-3k) = 0$
and study the root behavior when $k=1,\ p=2$.  
i know b = 7 and c = 1 so the the solution is x = -7/2 +- 1/2*sqrt(49-4) = 1/2(-7+-3sqrt(5)).

Q4. Parallel Resistive Circuit - misuses formula
'
I'm an 18 student studying for my exams my next physics exam is in 3 days and I need to know how to solve this, what am I doing wrong??
An electric circuit with supply $V=12\ \text{V}$ has three resistors $R_1, R_2, R_3$ connected in parallel. When $R_1 = 10\ \Omega,\ R_2 = 20\ \Omega.$ Determine $R_3$ such that $I_1 + I_2 = I_3.$  
I know that V = IR so in resistor 1: I_1 = V/R_1 = 1.2A and I_2 = V/R_2 = 0.6A so I need R_3 to be 12/1.2+12/0.6 as R = V/I for each resistor. I get R = 30 when I do this but the correct answer should something else.

Q5. Square Inscribed in a Circular Sector - uses an inapplicable formula incorrectly
'
I'm an 18 student studying for my exams my next math exam is in 3 days and I need to know how to solve this, what am I doing wrong??
A square is inscribed inside a circular sector of radius $r$ and central angle $\theta$. Two vertices lie on the radii, two lie on the arc (see image).
when $r = 10,\ \theta = 90^\circ.$ Find the area of the inscribed square.  
I know for a square in a circle the area is always the radius of the circle squared divided by 2, so shouldn't it be A=50 here? I keep getting questions like these wrong, how do I actually get this right consistently? What method do I need to use to ensure i dont mess the exam up?

Q6. Probability of Drawing Balls - misapplies formula (forgets black balls)
'
I'm an 18 student studying for my exams my next math exam is in 3 days and I need to know how to solve this, what am I doing wrong??
A bag contains $n$ blue balls, $m$ red balls, and $k$ black balls. If $r$ balls are drawn without replacement, what is the probability that exactly $q$ of them are red when $(n,m,k,r,q) = (7,5,4,4,3)$?
Using the formula P = (m choose q)(n choose (r-q))/((n+m choose r)) i get 14/99 but the correct answer is supposed to be something else
