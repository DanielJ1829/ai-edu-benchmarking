# Annotation Rubric (0–2 scale)

Each response is graded across **five categories**, scored 0–2.  
Total possible score: **10 points**.

---

## 1. Correctness
- **0 = Incorrect**  
  - Final answer wrong *and* ≥2 substantive reasoning errors.  
  - Misinterprets the problem entirely.  
- **1 = Partially correct**  
  - Final answer wrong due to one main algebraic/reasoning slip.  
  - Correct approach but flawed execution.  
- **2 = Fully correct**  
  - Final answer correct.  
  - Reasoning coherent and mathematically sound.

---

## 2. Completeness
- Note: reasoning is heavily user-appropriate. Step-by-step explanations work for beginners, but are unnecessary for advanced students.
- **0 = Fragmentary**  
  - Provides only a fragment of reasoning or just a number.  
  - Skips multiple essential steps.  
- **1 = Partial**  
  - Covers main ideas but omits 1–2 important steps.  
  - *OR* includes so much irrelevant material that the main solution becomes obscured.  
- **2 = Complete**  
  - All reasoning and results are present that reach the answer.
  - Provides just enough detail to solve the problem without unnecessary digressions.

---

## 3. Clarity
- Note: Clarity depends on the persona. Some jargon can be insightful for an advanced student but distracting for a beginner. 
- **0 = Unclear/confusing**  
  - Disorganised, hard to follow, or uses excessive jargon.  
  - Over-explains in a way that obscures the main point.  
- **1 = Somewhat clear**  
  - Understandable overall but has awkward phrasing or missing logical connectors.  
  - Requires rereading, or mixes in distracting side calculations.  
- **2 = Clear and well-structured**  
  - Step-by-step and easy to follow.  
  - Focused on the problem’s needs without under- or over-explaining.

---

## 4. Educational Value
- **0 = Low**  
  - Just gives a final answer, no explanation.  
  - Explanation irrelevant or misleading.  
- **1 = Moderate**  
  - Provides some reasoning but either too shallow *or* overwhelms the learner with unnecessary depth.
  - Explanation not tailored to the persona (e.g., too advanced for a struggling student).  
- **2 = High**  
  - Encourages learning and understanding.  
  - Accessible to the intended student level/persona. Steps explained appropriately for the persona
  - Explains reasoning **and** generalises where appropriate, giving the student transferable insight .

---

## 5. Tone
- **0 = Negative/dismissive**  
  - Curt, impatient, or condescending.  
- **1 = Neutral**  
  - Correct but dry or impersonal.  
- **2 = Positive/supportive**  
  - Encouraging, empathetic, and adapted to the persona (e.g., exam-stressed vs. adult learner).

---

## Scoring Notes
- **Total score:** 0–10 (sum of categories).  
- **Consistency matters** → use these criteria as a checklist.  
- If undecided between two scores, **choose the lower one** to avoid bias.  
- Write 1–2 sentences of justification per category.

## In the annotated responses:
- **Red Highlights** Denote examples of poor model behaviour
- **Yellow Highlights** Denote examples of neutral model behaviour (rarer)
- **Green Highlights** Denote examples of good model behaviour
- **Comments** (text inside <>) will be added to denote the attribute being displayed as good/neutral/poor behaviour. Inside these comments are 2 letter abbreviations for each attribute:

1. Cr - Correctness
2. Cm - Completeness
3. Cl - Clarity
4. Ed - Educational Value
5. Tn - Tone

## Flagging code:
1. <span style="color:()">Alternatively, we can use the hypergeometric distribution:
The probability of drawing exactly \( q \) red balls from \( m \) reds in \( r \) draws from a total of \( N = n + m + k = 8 \) balls is:</span> - labelling text
2. \textcolor{red/green/yellow}{x = A\cos45^\circ} - labelling LaTeX
3. Note: Labels of the form [n] go *inside* the LaTeX code where appropriate for readability

(note - DeepSeek's responses aren't annotated in the same way; they're converted to jupyter notebook friendly analysis by replacing both '\]' and '\[' with $$ for display math - inline is left as is.)
