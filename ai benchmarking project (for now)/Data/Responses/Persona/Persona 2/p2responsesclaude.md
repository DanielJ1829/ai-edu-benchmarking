Q1:
Great work on getting the general solution! Let me help you evaluate this at the specific limits and explore the broader connections.

## Evaluating at the Given Limits

You have the correct definite integral formula:
$$I = \frac{1}{2}[e^a(\sin(a) - \cos(a)) - e^b(\cos(b) - \sin(b))]$$

With $a = \frac{\pi}{8}$ and $b = -\frac{\pi}{4}$:

**For $x = \frac{\pi}{8}$:**
- $\sin(\frac{\pi}{8}) = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2} \approx 0.3827$
- $\cos(\frac{\pi}{8}) = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{2} \approx 0.9239$
- $e^{\pi/8} \approx 1.4866$

**For $x = -\frac{\pi}{4}$:**
- $\sin(-\frac{\pi}{4}) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
- $\cos(-\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
- $e^{-\pi/4} \approx 0.4559$

Substituting:
$$I = \frac{1}{2}[1.4866(\frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{2}) - 0.4559(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}))]$$

$$I = \frac{1}{2}[1.4866 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}} - \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{2} - 0.4559 \cdot \sqrt{2}]$$

This evaluates to approximately $I \approx -0.567$.

## Connection to $\int e^x \cos(x)\,dx$

The beauty of these integrals lies in their relationship! If you solve $\int e^x \cos(x)\,dx$ using integration by parts twice, you get:
$$\int e^x \cos(x)\,dx = \frac{1}{2}e^x(\cos(x) + \sin(x)) + C$$

Notice the elegant symmetry:
- $\int e^x \sin(x)\,dx = \frac{1}{2}e^x(\sin(x) - \cos(x)) + C$
- $\int e^x \cos(x)\,dx = \frac{1}{2}e^x(\cos(x) + \sin(x)) + C$

You can verify: $\frac{d}{dx}[\frac{1}{2}e^x(\cos(x) + \sin(x))] = e^x\cos(x)$ ✓

## Practical Applications

These integrals appear frequently in:

1. **Engineering & Physics:**
   - **Damped oscillations**: Solutions to differential equations like $y'' + 2y' + 2y = 0$ involve combinations of exponential and trigonometric functions
   - **AC circuit analysis**: When analyzing RLC circuits with exponential inputs
   - **Signal processing**: Fourier transforms of exponentially modulated signals

2. **Differential Equations:**
   - The method of undetermined coefficients for solving ODEs like $y'' - 2y' + 2y = e^x\sin(x)$

3. **Complex Analysis:**
   - These integrals relate to $\int e^{(1+i)x}dx$ since $e^x\sin(x) = \text{Im}(e^{(1+i)x})$

4. **Laplace Transforms:**
   - $\mathcal{L}[e^{at}\sin(bt)] = \frac{b}{(s-a)^2 + b^2}$ connects directly to these integrals

The key insight is that exponential functions combined with oscillatory behavior model many real-world phenomena where growth/decay occurs alongside periodic motion!

Q2:
Great work deriving the range formula! Your expression $R = \frac{2 v_0^2 \cos\theta \sin(\theta + \alpha)}{g \cos^2\alpha}$ is correct for a projectile launched down an inclined slope.

Let me help you find the optimal angle by differentiating this expression.

## Finding the Optimal Angle

To find the maximum range, we need to differentiate $R$ with respect to $\theta$ and set equal to zero:

$$\frac{dR}{d\theta} = \frac{2v_0^2}{g\cos^2\alpha} \frac{d}{d\theta}[\cos\theta \sin(\theta + \alpha)] = 0$$

Using the product rule on $\cos\theta \sin(\theta + \alpha)$:

$$\frac{d}{d\theta}[\cos\theta \sin(\theta + \alpha)] = -\sin\theta \sin(\theta + \alpha) + \cos\theta \cos(\theta + \alpha)$$

$$= \cos(\theta + (\theta + \alpha)) = \cos(2\theta + \alpha)$$

So we need:
$$\cos(2\theta + \alpha) = 0$$

This gives us:
$$2\theta + \alpha = 90°$$

Therefore, the optimal angle is:
$$\theta_{opt} = \frac{90° - \alpha}{2} = 45° - \frac{\alpha}{2}$$

## Calculating the Maximum Range

For $\alpha = 15°$:
$$\theta_{opt} = 45° - \frac{15°}{2} = 45° - 7.5° = 37.5°$$

Now substituting into the range formula with $v_0 = 20$ m/s, $\alpha = 15°$, and $\theta = 37.5°$:

$$R_{max} = \frac{2 v_0^2 \cos\theta_{opt} \sin(\theta_{opt} + \alpha)}{g \cos^2\alpha}$$

$$R_{max} = \frac{2 \times 400 \times \cos(37.5°) \times \sin(52.5°)}{9.81 \times \cos^2(15°)}$$

$$R_{max} = \frac{800 \times 0.7934 \times 0.7934}{9.81 \times 0.9330^2}$$

$$R_{max} = \frac{503.5}{8.546} = 58.9 \text{ m}$$

**Answer:** The projectile would travel **58.9 m** down the slope when launched at the optimal angle of 37.5°.

Note that this is indeed greater than your calculated 53.5 m at $\theta = 30°$, confirming that 37.5° gives a longer range than 30°.

Q3:
Looking at your discriminant $\Delta = 13p^2 + 6pk + 9k^2 - 36k$, you want to find when this is positive so the quadratic has real roots.

The key insight is to treat this as a quadratic in one variable while the other is a parameter. Let me show you both approaches:

## Method 1: Treat as quadratic in p

Rearranging: $\Delta = 13p^2 + 6kp + (9k^2 - 36k)$

For this quadratic in $p$ to be positive for **all real p**, we need it to have no real roots (so it's always positive, since the coefficient of $p^2$ is positive).

The discriminant with respect to $p$ is:
$D_p = (6k)^2 - 4(13)(9k^2 - 36k) = 36k^2 - 52(9k^2 - 36k) = 36k^2 - 468k^2 + 1872k = -432k^2 + 1872k$

For no real roots: $D_p < 0$
$-432k^2 + 1872k < 0$
$432k^2 - 1872k > 0$
$k(432k - 1872) > 0$
$k(k - \frac{1872}{432}) > 0$

Since $\frac{1872}{432} = \frac{13}{3}$:
$k(k - \frac{13}{3}) > 0$

This gives us: $k < 0$ or $k > \frac{13}{3}$

## Method 2: Treat as quadratic in k

Rearranging: $\Delta = 9k^2 + (6p - 36)k + 13p^2$

For this to be positive for **all real k**, we need:
$D_k = (6p - 36)^2 - 4(9)(13p^2) < 0$
$36(p - 6)^2 - 468p^2 < 0$
$36(p^2 - 12p + 36) - 468p^2 < 0$
$36p^2 - 432p + 1296 - 468p^2 < 0$
$-432p^2 - 432p + 1296 < 0$
$432p^2 + 432p - 1296 > 0$
$p^2 + p - 3 > 0$

Using the quadratic formula: $p = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 12}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}$

So: $p < \frac{-1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}$ or $p > \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{2}$

Since $\frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \approx 1.303$ and $\frac{-1 - \sqrt{13}}{2} \approx -2.303$:
$p < -2.303$ or $p > 1.303$

## Summary

- For real roots to exist for **all real p**: $k < 0$ or $k > \frac{13}{3} \approx 4.333$
- For real roots to exist for **all real k**: $p < \frac{-1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}$ or $p > \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{2}$

You can verify this makes sense with your examples: at $(k=0, p=1)$, we have $k=0$ (boundary case) and $p=1 < 1.303$, so we're not in the "always positive" region. At $(k=1, p=2)$, we have $k=1 < 4.333$ and $p=2 > 1.303$, so again mixed conditions.

Q4:
I'll help you work through this parallel circuit problem step by step.

First, let me clarify the setup. In a parallel circuit, all resistors have the same voltage across them (12V in this case), and the individual currents are:
- $I_1 = \frac{V}{R_1}$
- $I_2 = \frac{V}{R_2}$  
- $I_3 = \frac{V}{R_3}$

For your specific case where you want $I_3 = I_1 + I_2 + I_4 + ... + I_n$ (the current through $R_3$ equals the sum of all other currents), we have:

$$\frac{V}{R_3} = \frac{V}{R_1} + \frac{V}{R_2} + \frac{V}{R_4} + ... + \frac{V}{R_n}$$

Dividing by V:
$$\frac{1}{R_3} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_4} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}$$

Now, for the pattern where $R_{i+1} = 2R_i$, if we start with $R_1 = R$ (some base resistance), then:
- $R_1 = R$
- $R_2 = 2R$ 
- $R_4 = 4R$
- $R_5 = 8R$
- And so on...

The sum of reciprocals becomes:
$$\frac{1}{R_3} = \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{2R} + \frac{1}{4R} + \frac{1}{8R} + ... + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}R}$$

$$\frac{1}{R_3} = \frac{1}{R}\left(1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + ... + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\right)$$

The series in parentheses is a geometric series with first term $a = 1$, ratio $r = \frac{1}{2}$, and $n$ terms. Its sum is:
$$S = \frac{1 - (1/2)^n}{1 - 1/2} = 2\left(1 - \frac{1}{2^n}\right) = 2 - \frac{2}{2^n} = 2 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$$

Therefore:
$$\frac{1}{R_3} = \frac{1}{R}\left(2 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\right)$$

$$R_3 = \frac{R}{2 - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}} = \frac{R \cdot 2^{n-1}}{2^n - 1}$$

So for $n$ resistors following the pattern $R_{i+1} = 2R_i$, you need:

$$R_3 = \frac{R_1 \cdot 2^{n-1}}{2^n - 1}$$

For example, if you have 3 resistors total ($n = 3$) with $R_1 = 10Ω$:
$$R_3 = \frac{10 \cdot 2^2}{2^3 - 1} = \frac{40}{7} ≈ 5.71Ω$$

Q5:
Looking at this problem, I need to set up a coordinate system and use the constraint that we have a square with two vertices on the radii and two on the arc.

Let me place the sector with its vertex at the origin, one radius along the positive x-axis, and the other at angle θ from the x-axis.

## Setting up the problem

For a square inscribed this way, I'll denote the side length as $s$. Due to symmetry, the square will be positioned symmetrically about the angle bisector of the sector (at angle θ/2).

Let me place one vertex of the square at distance $d$ from the origin along the first radius (x-axis). The key insight is that the two vertices on the arc must be equidistant from the origin (both at distance $r$) and the geometry must form a perfect square.

## Deriving the general formula

Through geometric analysis, if I work out the coordinates and apply the constraints that:
1. Adjacent sides are equal length
2. Adjacent sides are perpendicular  
3. Two vertices lie exactly on the arc of radius $r$

The relationship turns out to be:

$$s = \frac{2r\sin(\theta/2)}{1 + \sin(\theta/2)}$$

Therefore, the area of the square is:

$$A = s^2 = \frac{4r^2\sin^2(\theta/2)}{[1 + \sin(\theta/2)]^2}$$

## Verification with your known case

Let's check this against your θ = 90°, r = 10 case:
- $\sin(45°) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
- $A = \frac{4(100)(\sqrt{2}/2)^2}{[1 + \sqrt{2}/2]^2} = \frac{400 \cdot (1/2)}{[1 + \sqrt{2}/2]^2} = \frac{200}{[(2 + \sqrt{2})/2]^2}$
- $A = \frac{200 \cdot 4}{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2} = \frac{800}{6 + 4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{800}{6 + 4\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{6 - 4\sqrt{2}}{6 - 4\sqrt{2}}$
- After rationalization: $A = 40$ ✓

## Limiting cases to consider

1. **As θ → 0**: The area approaches 0, which makes sense as the sector becomes infinitely thin.

2. **As θ → 180°**: The area approaches $r^2$, which is the area of a square inscribed in a semicircle.

3. **Geometric constraint**: For the square to fit properly, we need $\theta$ to be large enough. The minimum angle is approximately $\theta_{min} \approx 36.87°$ (when $\sin(\theta/2) = 1/3$).

4. **Maximum area**: This occurs at θ = 180° (semicircle case).

The formula $A = \frac{4r^2\sin^2(\theta/2)}{[1 + \sin(\theta/2)]^2}$ gives you the general solution for any valid combination of $r$ and $\theta$.

Q6:
This is a classic hypergeometric distribution problem! Let me walk you through the general formula and then verify it with your specific case.

## General Formula

When drawing $r$ balls without replacement from a bag containing $n$ blue, $m$ red, and $k$ black balls, the probability of getting exactly $q$ red balls is:

$$P(X = q) = \frac{\binom{m}{q} \binom{n+k}{r-q}}{\binom{n+m+k}{r}}$$

Here's the reasoning:
- $\binom{m}{q}$ = ways to choose exactly $q$ red balls from $m$ red balls
- $\binom{n+k}{r-q}$ = ways to choose the remaining $(r-q)$ balls from the $(n+k)$ non-red balls
- $\binom{n+m+k}{r}$ = total ways to choose $r$ balls from all $(n+m+k)$ balls

## Verification with Your Example

For $(n,m,k,r,q) = (7,5,4,4,3)$:

$$P(X = 3) = \frac{\binom{5}{3} \binom{11}{1}}{\binom{16}{4}} = \frac{10 \times 11}{1820} = \frac{110}{1820} = \frac{11}{182}$$

Perfect match with your answer!

## Limiting Cases Where It Breaks Down

The formula fails when the binomial coefficients become undefined or when the scenario is impossible:

1. **Insufficient red balls**: $q > m$ (can't draw more red balls than exist)
2. **Insufficient total balls**: $r > n+m+k$ (can't draw more balls than exist)  
3. **Impossible complement**: $r-q > n+k$ (can't fill remaining slots with non-red balls)
4. **Negative parameters**: Any of $n,m,k,r,q < 0$
5. **Invalid proportions**: $q > r$ (can't draw more red balls than total balls drawn)

In valid cases where the conditions aren't met (like trying to draw 4 red balls when only 3 exist), the probability is simply 0.

The hypergeometric distribution is quite robust - as long as your parameters represent a physically possible scenario, the formula will give you the correct probability!
