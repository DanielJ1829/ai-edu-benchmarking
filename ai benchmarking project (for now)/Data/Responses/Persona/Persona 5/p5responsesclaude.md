Q1:
I'd be happy to help you work through this integration problem! Let me address your question about odd functions first, then walk you through the solution.

**About the odd function idea:**
You're thinking of a different concept. An odd function f(x) has the property that f(-x) = -f(x), and when you integrate an odd function from -a to a, you get zero. But that's not what's happening here - your limits are 0 to π (not symmetric around zero), and e^x sin(x) isn't an odd function anyway. The fact that sin(0) = sin(π) = 0 doesn't make the integral zero - that's just the values of sine at those points, not the integral of the entire function.

**Solving the indefinite integral:**
For ∫ e^x sin(x) dx, we need to use integration by parts twice. This is a classic example where the technique creates a cycle that we can solve algebraically.

Let me use integration by parts: ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du

**First application:**
- Let u = sin(x), so du = cos(x) dx
- Let dv = e^x dx, so v = e^x

∫ e^x sin(x) dx = e^x sin(x) - ∫ e^x cos(x) dx

**Second application on the remaining integral:**
For ∫ e^x cos(x) dx:
- Let u = cos(x), so du = -sin(x) dx  
- Let dv = e^x dx, so v = e^x

∫ e^x cos(x) dx = e^x cos(x) - ∫ e^x(-sin(x)) dx = e^x cos(x) + ∫ e^x sin(x) dx

**Substituting back:**
∫ e^x sin(x) dx = e^x sin(x) - [e^x cos(x) + ∫ e^x sin(x) dx]
∫ e^x sin(x) dx = e^x sin(x) - e^x cos(x) - ∫ e^x sin(x) dx

**Solving algebraically:**
2∫ e^x sin(x) dx = e^x sin(x) - e^x cos(x)
∫ e^x sin(x) dx = (e^x/2)[sin(x) - cos(x)] + C

**For the definite integral:**
∫₀^π e^x sin(x) dx = [(e^x/2)[sin(x) - cos(x)]]₀^π

At x = π: (e^π/2)[sin(π) - cos(π)] = (e^π/2)[0 - (-1)] = e^π/2
At x = 0: (e^0/2)[sin(0) - cos(0)] = (1/2)[0 - 1] = -1/2

Therefore: ∫₀^π e^x sin(x) dx = e^π/2 - (-1/2) = (e^π + 1)/2

This is definitely not zero! The result is approximately (23.14 + 1)/2 ≈ 12.07.

The key insight is that integration by parts twice creates a solvable equation when you get back to your original integral.

Q2:
You're absolutely on the right track with SUVAT! That's exactly the approach we need here. Let me walk you through this step by step.

First, let's understand what we have:
- Initial speed: v₀ = 20 m/s
- Launch angle: θ = 30°
- Slope angle: α = 0° (this means it's flat ground, not actually a slope)

Since α = 0°, this is just a standard projectile motion problem on level ground.

**Step 1: Break down the initial velocity**
- Horizontal component: v₀ₓ = v₀ cos(θ) = 20 cos(30°) = 20 × (√3/2) = 10√3 ≈ 17.32 m/s
- Vertical component: v₀ᵧ = v₀ sin(θ) = 20 sin(30°) = 20 × 0.5 = 10 m/s

**Step 2: Find the time of flight**
For the vertical motion, we use s = ut + ½at² where:
- s = 0 (returns to ground level)
- u = v₀ᵧ = 10 m/s
- a = -g = -9.81 m/s²

0 = 10t - ½(9.81)t²
0 = t(10 - 4.905t)

This gives us t = 0 (launch) or t = 10/4.905 ≈ 2.04 seconds

**Step 3: Find the horizontal distance**
Using s = ut (no acceleration horizontally):
Distance = v₀ₓ × t = 10√3 × (20/9.81) = 200√3/9.81 ≈ 35.3 m

So the projectile travels approximately **35.3 meters** along the ground before landing.

You were spot on with the SUVAT approach! The key insight is breaking the motion into horizontal and vertical components and using the appropriate kinematic equation for each direction.

Q3:
I'd be happy to help you work through this quadratic equation! You're absolutely right about the quadratic formula - that's exactly the right approach.

Let me start by identifying the coefficients in your equation:
$3x^2 + (p+3k)x - (p^2-3k) = 0$

So we have:
- $a = 3$
- $b = (p+3k)$  
- $c = -(p^2-3k)$

Now, when $k=0$ and $p=1$, let's substitute these values:
- $a = 3$
- $b = (1+3(0)) = 1$
- $c = -(1^2-3(0)) = -(1-0) = -1$

So our specific equation becomes: $3x^2 + x - 1 = 0$

Now let's apply the quadratic formula:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2-4(3)(-1)}}{2(3)}$$

$$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1+12}}{6} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{6}$$

So the two roots are:
- $x_1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{6} \approx \frac{-1 + 3.606}{6} \approx 0.434$
- $x_2 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{13}}{6} \approx \frac{-1 - 3.606}{6} \approx -0.768$

I think I see where you might have made an error - it's easy to mix up signs or make arithmetic mistakes with the discriminant. The values you got (2 and -7/3) don't match what we should get here.

Let me verify one of our answers by substituting back into $3x^2 + x - 1 = 0$:

For $x_1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{6}$:
$3\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{6}\right)^2 + \frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{6} - 1$

This should equal zero (though the algebra gets a bit messy to show completely).

Would you like to walk through your calculation step by step so we can spot exactly where the error occurred?

Q4:
I can definitely help you work through this! It's great that you're getting back into physics - circuit problems can be tricky at first, but once you understand the key principles, they become much clearer.

The main issue with your approach is a common misconception about parallel circuits. In parallel circuits, the resistors don't simply add up like they do in series circuits. Let me walk you through the correct approach:

## Key Principles for Parallel Circuits:

1. **Same voltage across each resistor**: In a parallel circuit, each resistor experiences the full supply voltage (12V in this case)
2. **Different currents**: Each resistor will have its own current based on its resistance
3. **Total current splits**: The total current from the source divides among the parallel branches

## Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Find the current through each resistor**
Since each resistor has 12V across it, we can use Ohm's law (V = IR, or I = V/R) for each one:

- Current through R₁: I₁ = V/R₁ = 12V/10Ω = 1.2 A
- Current through R₂: I₂ = V/R₂ = 12V/20Ω = 0.6 A  
- Current through R₃: I₃ = V/R₃ = 12V/15Ω = 0.8 A

**Step 2: Verify with total current (optional check)**
The total current should equal the sum of individual currents:
I_total = I₁ + I₂ + I₃ = 1.2 + 0.6 + 0.8 = 2.6 A

## The Key Insight:
In parallel circuits, think of it like water flowing through pipes - the water pressure (voltage) is the same in each pipe, but wider pipes (lower resistance) allow more water (current) to flow through them.

Notice how R₁ (smallest resistance) carries the most current, while R₂ (largest resistance) carries the least current. This makes physical sense - electricity takes the path of least resistance!

Does this approach make sense? The math is actually much simpler than you initially thought once you apply the right principle.

Q5:
I'd be happy to help you work through this geometry problem! Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what we have:
- A circular sector with radius $r$ and central angle $\theta = 90°$
- A square inscribed in this sector
- Two vertices of the square lie on the radii (the straight edges)
- Two vertices lie on the arc (the curved edge)
- The square has area $A = 8 \text{ m}^2$

Let me set up a coordinate system to solve this systematically.

I'll place the center of the circle at the origin, with one radius along the positive x-axis and the other along the positive y-axis (since $\theta = 90°$).

Let's say the square has side length $s$. Since the area is $8 \text{ m}^2$:
$$s^2 = 8$$
$$s = 2\sqrt{2} \text{ m}$$

Now, here's the key insight: due to the symmetry of the problem (90° sector with a square), the square will be positioned symmetrically. The two vertices on the radii will be equidistant from the origin.

Let's call the distance from the origin to each vertex on the radii as $d$. Due to the geometry:
- One vertex is at $(d, 0)$ on the x-axis
- Another vertex is at $(0, d)$ on the y-axis
- The other two vertices are on the arc

Since it's a square, the vertex diagonally opposite to the one at $(d, 0)$ is at $(0, d)$. The side length of the square is the distance between adjacent vertices.

The vertex at $(d, 0)$ connects to a vertex on the arc. Due to symmetry, this vertex on the arc is at $(d + s\cos(45°), s\sin(45°)) = (d + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}})$.

But this vertex must also lie on the circle of radius $r$, so:
$$(d + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}})^2 + (\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}})^2 = r^2$$

Also, since we have a square, the distance from $(d, 0)$ to the vertex on the arc must equal $s$:
$$\sqrt{(\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}})^2 + (\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}})^2} = s$$

This confirms our geometry is correct.

From the constraint that the vertex lies on the circle:
$$(d + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}})^2 + \frac{s^2}{2} = r^2$$

The vertex on the arc that we want (top-right) is at $(d + \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}})$.

Since $s = 2\sqrt{2}$:
- $\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 2$

So our vertex on the arc is at $(d + 2, 2)$.

From the circle equation:
$$(d + 2)^2 + 4 = r^2$$

We also know that due to the square's geometry, $d = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} = 2$.

Therefore: $(2 + 2)^2 + 4 = r^2$
$$16 + 4 = r^2$$
$$r^2 = 20$$
$$r = 2\sqrt{5} \text{ m}$$

The distance from the origin to the top-right vertex is simply $r = 2\sqrt{5} \text{ m}$.

Therefore, the distance between the top-right square vertex and the circle center is $\boxed{2\sqrt{5} \text{ m}}$ or approximately $4.47 \text{ m}$.

Q6:
I'd be happy to help you work through this counting problem! Your intuition about needing to consider different orderings is actually on the right track, but let me show you the systematic approach.

This is a **hypergeometric probability** problem. When you're drawing balls without replacement and want exactly a certain number of a specific type, hypergeometric is the way to go.

Let me break down your specific problem:
- Total balls: n + m + k = 5 + 3 + 0 = 8 balls
- Drawing r = 3 balls
- Want exactly q = 2 red balls (out of m = 3 total red balls)

The hypergeometric formula is:
P(exactly q red) = C(m,q) × C(n+k, r-q) / C(n+m+k, r)

Where C(a,b) means "a choose b" = a!/(b!(a-b)!)

Let's calculate each piece:

**C(3,2)** = ways to choose 2 red from 3 red balls = 3!/(2!×1!) = 3

**C(5,1)** = ways to choose 1 blue from 5 blue balls = 5!/(1!×4!) = 5

**C(8,3)** = ways to choose 3 balls from 8 total = 8!/(3!×5!) = 56

So: P(exactly 2 red) = (3 × 5) / 56 = 15/56 ≈ 0.268

Your answer of 0.26 was actually very close! The issue with your approach was that you were thinking about specific sequences (red-red-blue), but you correctly intuited that order matters and tried to account for it.

The hypergeometric formula automatically handles all the different ways to arrange 2 red balls and 1 blue ball among 3 draws, which is why it gives the exact answer.

Does this approach make sense? The key insight is recognizing this as a "drawing without replacement" scenario, which leads you to hypergeometric rather than binomial probability.
