Q1:
I can see where you're going wrong with this integration by parts problem! Let me help you get the method down properly so you'll nail these on your exam.

**Your main mistake:** You only did integration by parts once, but this integral requires doing it *twice* because you get back to a similar integral.

Here's the correct approach:

**Step 1: First integration by parts**
- Let $u = e^x$, $dv = \sin(x)dx$
- Then $du = e^x dx$, $v = -\cos(x)$

$$\int e^x \sin(x) dx = -e^x \cos(x) - \int (-\cos(x))(e^x) dx$$
$$= -e^x \cos(x) + \int e^x \cos(x) dx$$

**Step 2: Second integration by parts on the new integral**
For $\int e^x \cos(x) dx$:
- Let $u = e^x$, $dv = \cos(x)dx$  
- Then $du = e^x dx$, $v = \sin(x)$

$$\int e^x \cos(x) dx = e^x \sin(x) - \int e^x \sin(x) dx$$

**Step 3: Substitute back and solve**
$$\int e^x \sin(x) dx = -e^x \cos(x) + e^x \sin(x) - \int e^x \sin(x) dx$$

Let $I = \int e^x \sin(x) dx$. Then:
$$I = -e^x \cos(x) + e^x \sin(x) - I$$
$$2I = e^x(\sin(x) - \cos(x))$$
$$I = \frac{e^x(\sin(x) - \cos(x))}{2} + C$$

**Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral**
$$\int_{\pi/6}^{3\pi/4} e^x \sin(x) dx = \left[\frac{e^x(\sin(x) - \cos(x))}{2}\right]_{\pi/6}^{3\pi/4}$$

At $x = 3\pi/4$: $\sin(3\pi/4) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $\cos(3\pi/4) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$
At $x = \pi/6$: $\sin(\pi/6) = \frac{1}{2}$, $\cos(\pi/6) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

$$= \frac{e^{3\pi/4}(\sqrt{2})}{2} - \frac{e^{\pi/6}(1/2 - \sqrt{3}/2)}{2}$$

**Method to master these problems:**
1. **Always expect to do integration by parts twice** when you have $e^x$ with trig functions
2. **Keep track of your work** - write out each step clearly
3. **Remember the "cyclic" property** - you'll get back to your original integral, which lets you solve algebraically
4. **Practice the standard patterns**: $e^x \sin(x)$, $e^x \cos(x)$, $x^n e^x$, $x^n \ln(x)$

The key insight you missed is that getting back to the original integral isn't a dead end - it's actually the solution method! This happens with several integration by parts problems.

Would you like me to show you a few more examples of this "double integration by parts" technique so you can practice before your exam?

Q2:
I can see the issue with your approach - you're mixing up the coordinate systems and not accounting for the slope properly. Let me walk you through the correct method step by step.

## The Problem with Your Current Approach

You're treating this like a standard projectile motion problem on flat ground, but the projectile lands on an inclined slope, not back at the same height. Your equation `s = 20sin(30)t - 0.5g*t^2 = 0` assumes the projectile returns to its starting height, which isn't correct here.

## The Correct Method

**Step 1: Set up your coordinate system**
- Origin at launch point
- x-axis: horizontal (positive right)  
- y-axis: vertical (positive up)
- The slope goes downward at angle α below horizontal

**Step 2: Write the motion equations**
- x(t) = v₀cos(θ)t = 20cos(30°)t
- y(t) = v₀sin(θ)t - ½gt² = 20sin(30°)t - ½gt²

**Step 3: Find the slope equation**
The slope passes through the origin and goes down at angle α:
y = -x·tan(α) = -x·tan(15°)

**Step 4: Find when projectile hits the slope**
At impact: y(t) = -x(t)·tan(15°)

Substituting:
20sin(30°)t - ½gt² = -20cos(30°)t·tan(15°)

Rearranging:
½gt² - 20sin(30°)t - 20cos(30°)t·tan(15°) = 0
½gt² - 20t[sin(30°) + cos(30°)tan(15°)] = 0

Since t ≠ 0:
½gt - 20[sin(30°) + cos(30°)tan(15°)] = 0

**Step 5: Solve for t**
t = (40/g)[sin(30°) + cos(30°)tan(15°)]
t = (40/9.81)[0.5 + (√3/2)(tan(15°))]
t = (40/9.81)[0.5 + 0.866 × 0.268]
t = (40/9.81)[0.5 + 0.232] = (40/9.81)(0.732) ≈ 2.98 s

**Step 6: Find distance along slope**
x = 20cos(30°) × 2.98 ≈ 51.6 m
y = 20sin(30°) × 2.98 - ½(9.81)(2.98)² ≈ -13.8 m

Distance along slope: s = √(x² + y²) ≈ 53.4 m

## Key Strategy for Exam Success

**The foolproof method:**
1. **Always draw a clear diagram** showing coordinates, angles, and slope
2. **Write motion equations** in standard x-y coordinates first
3. **Find the constraint equation** (slope equation: y = -x·tan(α))
4. **Substitute and solve** for the time of impact
5. **Calculate final answer** using that time

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Don't assume the projectile lands at the same height
- Don't forget the slope constraint equation
- Double-check your trigonometry (slopes go DOWN at angle α)
- Always verify units and reasonableness of your answer

This systematic approach works for any projectile-on-slope problem. Practice it a few times and you'll nail these questions every time!

Q3:
I can see where you went wrong! Let me walk you through this step by step and then give you a reliable method to avoid these mistakes on your exam.

**What you did wrong:**

When k=1 and p=2, you correctly found that the equation becomes:
$3x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0$

But you made two critical errors:
1. You used the wrong value for 'a' - you treated it as if a=1, but actually a=3
2. You miscalculated c: when p=2 and k=1, c = -(p²-3k) = -(4-3) = -1, not +1

**Correct solution:**

For $3x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0$:
- a = 3, b = 7, c = -1

Using the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$

$x = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{49-4(3)(-1)}}{2(3)} = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{49+12}}{6} = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{61}}{6}$

**Foolproof exam method:**

1. **Always write out a, b, c explicitly** before substituting anything
2. **Double-check your substitutions** - substitute the parameter values carefully
3. **Write the quadratic formula completely** before plugging in numbers
4. **Check your arithmetic step-by-step** - especially signs and multiplication

For this type of problem:
- First substitute the given parameter values (k=1, p=2)
- Simplify to get the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0
- Clearly identify a, b, c
- Apply the quadratic formula methodically

The key is being systematic rather than trying to do multiple steps in your head. Write everything down clearly - this prevents the careless errors that are costing you marks!

Q4:
I can see where you're going wrong! Let me walk through this step-by-step and then give you a solid method for tackling these problems.

**Your Error:**
You calculated I₁ = 1.2A and I₂ = 0.6A correctly, but then you wrote:
R₃ = 12/(1.2 + 0.6) = 12/1.8 = 6.67Ω

What you actually calculated was R₃ = V/(I₁ + I₂), but the condition is I₃ = I₁ + I₂, so:
- I₃ = 1.2 + 0.6 = 1.8A
- R₃ = V/I₃ = 12V/1.8A = 6.67Ω

**So your answer of ~6.67Ω is actually correct!** (Not 30Ω - that would be if you mistakenly added the currents incorrectly)

**Foolproof Method for Parallel Circuit Problems:**

1. **Write down what you know:**
   - Voltage is the same across all parallel branches: V₁ = V₂ = V₃ = V_supply
   - Current splits: I_total = I₁ + I₂ + I₃

2. **Use Ohm's Law for each resistor:**
   - I₁ = V/R₁
   - I₂ = V/R₂  
   - I₃ = V/R₃

3. **Apply the given condition carefully:**
   - Read exactly what the problem asks for
   - In this case: I₁ + I₂ = I₃

4. **Substitute and solve:**
   - I₃ = I₁ + I₂ = V/R₁ + V/R₂
   - Since I₃ = V/R₃, we have: V/R₃ = V/R₁ + V/R₂
   - Divide by V: 1/R₃ = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂
   - Therefore: 1/R₃ = 1/10 + 1/20 = 2/20 + 1/20 = 3/20
   - So: R₃ = 20/3 = 6.67Ω

**Key Tips to Avoid Exam Mistakes:**
- Always double-check what the question is actually asking
- Write out your known equations before substituting numbers
- For parallel circuits, remember voltage is constant, current splits
- For series circuits, remember current is constant, voltage splits
- Always check if your final answer makes physical sense

Your physics understanding is solid - you just need to be more careful with reading the problem and organizing your work!

Q5:
I can see the confusion! You're thinking of a different problem - the formula you mentioned (area = r²/2) applies to a square inscribed in a full circle, not a circular sector like this one.

Let me show you the correct approach for this type of problem:

## Setting up the coordinate system

For a sector problem like this, always use coordinates with the sector's vertex at the origin and one radius along the positive x-axis.

- Place the sector with vertex at origin
- One radius along positive x-axis
- Other radius at angle θ = 90°, so along positive y-axis
- The arc connects points (10, 0) and (0, 10)

## Finding the square's position

Since the square has two vertices on each radius:
- Let's say the square has side length s
- One vertex at (a, 0) on the x-axis
- Adjacent vertex at (a+s, 0) 
- The other two vertices must be at (a, s) and (a+s, s)

## Using the constraint

The key insight: the two upper vertices must lie on the circular arc, so they satisfy x² + y² = r² = 100.

For the vertex at (a+s, s) to be on the arc:
(a + s)² + s² = 100

Also, by symmetry of this 90° sector with the square positioned this way:
The vertex at (a, s) must also be on the arc: a² + s² = 100

## Solving the system

From a² + s² = 100, we get: a² = 100 - s²
From (a + s)² + s² = 100:

Expanding: a² + 2as + s² + s² = 100
Substituting a² = 100 - s²: (100 - s²) + 2as + 2s² = 100
This simplifies to: 2as + s² = 0
So: s(2a + s) = 0

Since s ≠ 0, we have: 2a + s = 0, so a = -s/2

Substituting back: (-s/2)² + s² = 100
s²/4 + s² = 100
5s²/4 = 100
s² = 80

Therefore: **Area = s² = 80**

## Method for exam success

1. **Always draw a coordinate system** - place the vertex at origin
2. **Use the constraints systematically** - vertices on radii have one coordinate = 0, vertices on arc satisfy x² + y² = r²
3. **Look for symmetry** - it often simplifies the algebra
4. **Don't memorize formulas for specific cases** - each inscribed shape problem is unique

The area is **80**, not 50. Your formula only works for squares inscribed in complete circles, not sectors!

Q6:
Looking at your problem, I can see where the confusion is coming from. You're using the right approach but with the wrong formula for this specific setup.

**What you're doing wrong:**

Your formula `P = (m choose q)(n choose (r-q))/((n+m choose r))` is for a bag with only **two types** of balls (red and non-red). But this problem has **three distinct types**: blue, red, AND black balls.

**The correct approach:**

For three types of balls, you need the **hypergeometric distribution** with multiple categories:

P = [(m choose q) × (n+k choose r-q)] / (n+m+k choose r)

Where:
- (m choose q) = ways to choose exactly q red balls from m red balls
- (n+k choose r-q) = ways to choose the remaining (r-q) balls from the (n+k) non-red balls
- (n+m+k choose r) = total ways to choose r balls from all balls

**Let's calculate:**
- Total balls: n+m+k = 7+5+4 = 16
- (5 choose 3) = 10
- (11 choose 1) = 11  [since r-q = 4-3 = 1, and n+k = 7+4 = 11]
- (16 choose 4) = 1820

P = (10 × 11) / 1820 = 110/1820 = 11/182

**Your error:** You used (n+m choose r) = (12 choose 4) = 495 in the denominator, but you should use (n+m+k choose r) = (16 choose 4) = 1820.

**How to get these right consistently:**

1. **Always identify all ball types** - don't assume it's just two categories
2. **Write down what you want vs. what remains** - you want q red balls, so you need (r-q) balls from everything else
3. **Check your total** - make sure your denominator uses ALL balls in the bag
4. **Practice the pattern**: (want from type 1) × (want from everything else) / (total ways)

The key insight: when there are multiple distinct types, group them strategically - separate what you're targeting from everything else, but count everything in the total.
